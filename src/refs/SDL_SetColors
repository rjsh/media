<doc f='include/SDL/SDL_video.h' l='451'>/**
 * Sets a portion of the colormap for the given 8-bit surface.  If &apos;surface&apos;
 * is not a palettized surface, this function does nothing, returning 0.
 * If all of the colors were set as passed to SDL_SetColors(), it will
 * return 1.  If not all the color entries were set exactly as given,
 * it will return 0, and you should look at the surface palette to
 * determine the actual color palette.
 *
 * When &apos;surface&apos; is the surface associated with the current display, the
 * display colormap will be updated with the requested colors.  If 
 * SDL_HWPALETTE was set in SDL_SetVideoMode() flags, SDL_SetColors()
 * will always return 1, and the palette is guaranteed to be set the way
 * you desire, even if the window colormap has to be warped or run under
 * emulation.
