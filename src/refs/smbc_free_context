 * Delete a SBMCCTX (a context) acquired from smbc_new_context().
 *
 * The context will be deleted if possible.
 *
 * @param context   A pointer to a SMBCCTX obtained from smbc_new_context()
 *
 * @param shutdown_ctx   If 1, all connections and files will be closed even if they are busy.
 *
 *
 * @return          Returns 0 on succes. Returns 1 on failure with errno set:
 *                  - EBUSY Server connections are still used, Files are open or cache
 *                          could not be purged
 *                  - EBADF context == NULL
 *
 * @see             smbc_new_context()

 * @note            It is advised to clean up all the contexts with shutdown_ctx set to 1
 *                  just before exit()&apos;ing. When shutdown_ctx is 0, this function can be
