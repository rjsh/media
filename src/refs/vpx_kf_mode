   *
   * This enumeration determines whether keyframes are placed automatically by
   * the encoder or whether this behavior is disabled. Older releases of this
   * SDK were implemented such that VPX_KF_FIXED meant keyframes were disabled.
   * This name is confusing for this behavior, so the new symbols to be used
   * are VPX_KF_AUTO and VPX_KF_DISABLED.
