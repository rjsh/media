   *
   * VP9 has a segment based feature that allows encoder to adaptively change
   * quantization parameter for each segment within a frame to improve the
   * subjective quality. This control makes encoder operate in one of the
   * several AQ_modes supported.
   *
   * By default, encoder operates with AQ_Mode 0(adaptive quantization off).
   *
   * Supported in codecs: VP9
