 * \brief Fill AAC decoder&apos;s internal input buffer with bitstream data from the external input buffer.
 *  The function only copies such data as long as the decoder-internal input buffer is not full.
 *  So it grabs whatever it can from pBuffer and returns information (bytesValid) so that at a
 *  subsequent call of %aacDecoder_Fill(), the right position in pBuffer can be determined to
 *  grab the next data.
 *
 * \param self        AAC decoder handle.
 * \param pBuffer     Pointer to external input buffer.
 * \param bufferSize  Size of external input buffer. This argument is required because decoder-internally
 *                    we need the information to calculate the offset to pBuffer, where the next
 *                    available data is, which is then fed into the decoder-internal buffer (as much
 *                    as possible). Our example framework implementation fills the buffer at pBuffer
 *                    again, once it contains no available valid bytes anymore (meaning bytesValid equal 0).
 * \param bytesValid  Number of bitstream bytes in the external bitstream buffer that have not yet been
 *                    copied into the decoder&apos;s internal bitstream buffer by calling this function.
 *                    The value is updated according to the amount of newly copied bytes.
 * \return            Error code.
