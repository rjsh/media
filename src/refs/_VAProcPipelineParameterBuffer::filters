     * \brief Array of filters to apply to the surface.
     *
     * The list of filters shall be ordered in the same way the driver expects
     * them. i.e. as was returned from vaQueryVideoProcFilters().
     * Otherwise, a #VA_STATUS_ERROR_INVALID_FILTER_CHAIN is returned
     * from vaRenderPicture() with this buffer.
     *
     * #VA_STATUS_ERROR_UNSUPPORTED_FILTER is returned if the list
     * contains an unsupported filter.
     *
     * Note: no filter buffer is destroyed after a call to vaRenderPicture(),
     * only this pipeline buffer will be destroyed as per the core API
     * specification. This allows for flexibility in re-using the filter for
     * other surfaces to be processed.
