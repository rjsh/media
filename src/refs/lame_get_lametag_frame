 * OPTIONAL:
 * lame_get_lametag_frame copies the final LAME-tag into &apos;buffer&apos;.
 * The function returns the number of bytes copied into buffer, or
 * the required buffer size, if the provided buffer is too small.
 * Function failed, if the return value is larger than &apos;size&apos;!
 * Make sure lame_encode flush has been called before calling this function.
 * NOTE:
 * if VBR  tags are turned off by the user, or turned off by LAME,
 * this call does nothing and returns 0.
 * NOTE:
 * LAME inserted an empty frame in the beginning of mp3 audio data,
 * which you have to replace by the final LAME-tag frame after encoding.
 * In case there is no ID3v2 tag, usually this frame will be the very first
 * data in your mp3 file. If you put some other leading data into your
 * file, you&apos;ll have to do some bookkeeping about where to write this buffer.
