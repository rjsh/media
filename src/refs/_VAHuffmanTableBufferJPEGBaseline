 * \brief Huffman table for JPEG decoding.
 *
 * This structure holds the complete Huffman tables. This is an
 * aggregation of all Huffman table (DHT) segments maintained by the
 * application. i.e. up to 2 Huffman tables are stored in there for
 * baseline profile.
 *
 * The #load_huffman_table array can be used as a hint to notify the
 * VA driver implementation about which table(s) actually changed
 * since the last submission of this buffer.
