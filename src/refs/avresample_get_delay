 * Return the number of samples currently in the resampling delay buffer.
 *
 * When resampling, there may be a delay between the input and output. Any
 * unconverted samples in each call are stored internally in a delay buffer.
 * This function allows the user to determine the current number of samples in
 * the delay buffer, which can be useful for synchronization.
