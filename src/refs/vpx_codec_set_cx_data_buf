   *
   * Sets the buffer that the codec should output the compressed data
   * into. This call effectively sets the buffer pointer returned in the
   * next VPX_CODEC_CX_FRAME_PKT packet. Subsequent packets will be
   * appended into this buffer. The buffer is preserved across frames,
   * so applications must periodically call this function after flushing
   * the accumulated compressed data to disk or to the network to reset
   * the pointer to the buffer&apos;s head.
   *
   * `pad_before` bytes will be skipped before writing the compressed
   * data, and `pad_after` bytes will be appended to the packet. The size
   * of the packet will be the sum of the size of the actual compressed
   * data, pad_before, and pad_after. The padding bytes will be preserved
   * (not overwritten).
   *
   * Note that calling this function does not guarantee that the returned
   * compressed data will be placed into the specified buffer. In the
   * event that the encoded data will not fit into the buffer provided,
   * the returned packet \ref MAY point to an internal buffer, as it would
   * if this call were never used. In this event, the output packet will
   * NOT have any padding, and the application must free space and copy it
   * to the proper place. This is of particular note in configurations
   * that may output multiple packets for a single encoded frame (e.g., lagged
   * encoding) or if the application does not reset the buffer periodically.
   *
   * Applications may restore the default behavior of the codec providing
   * the compressed data buffer by calling this function with a NULL
   * buffer.
   *
   * Applications \ref MUSTNOT call this function during iteration of
   * vpx_codec_get_cx_data().
   *
   * \param[in]    ctx         Pointer to this instance&apos;s context
   * \param[in]    buf         Buffer to store compressed data into
   * \param[in]    pad_before  Bytes to skip before writing compressed data
   * \param[in]    pad_after   Bytes to skip after writing compressed data
   *
   * \retval #VPX_CODEC_OK
   *     The buffer was set successfully.
   * \retval #VPX_CODEC_INVALID_PARAM
   *     A parameter was NULL, the image format is unsupported, etc.
