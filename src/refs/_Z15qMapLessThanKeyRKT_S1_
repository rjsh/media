    QMap uses qMapLessThanKey() to compare keys. The default
    implementation uses operator&lt;(). For pointer types,
    qMapLessThanKey() casts the pointers to integers before it
    compares them, because operator&lt;() is undefined on pointers
    that come from different memory blocks. (In practice, this
    is only a problem when running a program such as
    BoundsChecker.)
