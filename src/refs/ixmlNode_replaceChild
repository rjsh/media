 * \brief Replaces an existing child \b Node with a new child \b Node in the
 * list of children of a \b Node.
 *
 * If \b newChild is already in the tree, it will first be removed.
 * \b returnNode will contain the \b oldChild \b Node, appropriately removed
 * from the tree (i.e. it will no longer have an owner document).
 *
 * \return An integer representing one of the following:
 *      \li \c IXML_SUCCESS: The operation completed successfully.
 *      \li \c IXML_INVALID_PARAMTER: Either \b nodeptr, \b newChild,
 *      	or \b oldChild is \c NULL.
 *      \li \c IXML_HIERARCHY_REQUEST_ERR: The \b newChild is not 
 *            a type of \b Node that can be inserted into this tree or 
 *            \b newChild is an ancestor of \b nodePtr.
 *      \li \c IXML_WRONG_DOCUMENT_ERR: \b newChild was created from 
 *            a different document than \b nodeptr.
 *      \li \c IXML_NO_MODIFICATION_ALLOWED_ERR: \b nodeptr or 
 *            its parent is read-only.
 *      \li \c IXML_NOT_FOUND_ERR: \b oldChild is not a child of 
 *            \b nodeptr.
