     Combinations of the three values carry the following implications:

     all three set to the same value:
       implies a fixed rate bitstream
     only nominal set:
       implies a VBR stream that averages the nominal bitrate.  No hard
       upper/lower limit
     upper and or lower set:
       implies a VBR bitstream that obeys the bitrate limits. nominal
       may also be set to give a nominal rate.
     none set:
       the coder does not care to speculate.
