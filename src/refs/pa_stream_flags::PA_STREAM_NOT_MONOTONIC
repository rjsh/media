     * pa_stream_get_latency() and pa_stream_get_time() will try to
     * estimate the current record/playback time based on the local
     * time that passed since the last timing info update.  Using this
     * option has the advantage of not requiring a whole roundtrip
     * when the current playback/recording time is needed. Consider
     * using this option when requesting latency information
     * frequently. This is especially useful on long latency network
     * connections. It makes a lot of sense to combine this option
     * with PA_STREAM_AUTO_TIMING_UPDATE. */</doc>
