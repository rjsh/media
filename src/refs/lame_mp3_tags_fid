 * OPTIONAL:
 * lame_mp3_tags_fid will rewrite a Xing VBR tag to the mp3 file with file
 * pointer fid.  These calls perform forward and backwards seeks, so make
 * sure fid is a real file.  Make sure lame_encode_flush has been called,
 * and all mp3 data has been written to the file before calling this
 * function.
 * NOTE:
 * if VBR  tags are turned off by the user, or turned off by LAME because
 * the output is not a regular file, this call does nothing
 * NOTE:
 * LAME wants to read from the file to skip an optional ID3v2 tag, so
 * make sure you opened the file for writing and reading.
 * NOTE:
 * You can call lame_get_lametag_frame instead, if you want to insert
 * the lametag yourself.
