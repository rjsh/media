<doc f='include/SDL/SDL_video.h' l='562'>/**
 * SDL_LockSurface() sets up a surface for directly accessing the pixels.
 * Between calls to SDL_LockSurface()/SDL_UnlockSurface(), you can write
 * to and read from &apos;surface-&gt;pixels&apos;, using the pixel format stored in 
 * &apos;surface-&gt;format&apos;.  Once you are done accessing the surface, you should 
 * use SDL_UnlockSurface() to release it.
 *
 * Not all surfaces require locking.  If SDL_MUSTLOCK(surface) evaluates
 * to 0, then you can read and write to the surface at any time, and the
 * pixel format of the surface will not change.  In particular, if the
 * SDL_HWSURFACE flag is not given when calling SDL_SetVideoMode(), you
 * will not need to lock the display surface before accessing it.
 * 
 * No operating system or library calls should be made between lock/unlock
 * pairs, as critical system locks may be held during this time.
 *
 * SDL_LockSurface() returns 0, or -1 if the surface couldn&apos;t be locked.
