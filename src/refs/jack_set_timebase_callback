 * Register as timebase master for the JACK subsystem.
 *
 * The timebase master registers a callback that updates extended
 * position information such as beats or timecode whenever necessary.
 * Without this extended information, there is no need for this
 * function.
 *
 * There is never more than one master at a time.  When a new client
 * takes over, the former @a timebase_callback is no longer called.
 * Taking over the timebase may be done conditionally, so it fails if
 * there was a master already.
 *
 * The method may be called whether the client has been activated or not.
 *
 * @param client the JACK client structure.
 * @param conditional non-zero for a conditional request.
 * @param timebase_callback is a realtime function that returns
 * position information.
 * @param arg an argument for the @a timebase_callback function.
 *
 * @return
 *   - 0 on success;
 *   - EBUSY if a conditional request fails because there was already a
 *   timebase master;
 *   - other non-zero error code.
