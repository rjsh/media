<doc f='include/fribidi/fribidi-bidi.h' l='47'>/* fribidi_get_par_direction - get base paragraph direction
 *
 * This function finds the base direction of a single paragraph,
 * as defined by rule P2 of the Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm available at
 * http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr9/#P2.
 *
 * You typically do not need this function as
 * fribidi_get_par_embedding_levels() knows how to compute base direction
 * itself, but you may need this to implement a more sophisticated paragraph
 * direction handling.  Note that you can pass more than a paragraph to this
 * function and the direction of the first non-neutral paragraph is returned,
 * which is a very good heuristic to set direction of the neutral paragraphs
 * at the beginning of text.  For other neutral paragraphs, you better use the
 * direction of the previous paragraph.
 *
 * Returns: Base pargraph direction.  No weak paragraph direction is returned,
 * only LTR, RTL, or ON.
