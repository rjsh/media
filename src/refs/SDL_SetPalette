<doc f='include/SDL/SDL_video.h' l='469'>/**
 * Sets a portion of the colormap for a given 8-bit surface.
 * &apos;flags&apos; is one or both of:
 * SDL_LOGPAL  -- set logical palette, which controls how blits are mapped
 *                to/from the surface,
 * SDL_PHYSPAL -- set physical palette, which controls how pixels look on
 *                the screen
 * Only screens have physical palettes. Separate change of physical/logical
 * palettes is only possible if the screen has SDL_HWPALETTE set.
 *
 * The return value is 1 if all colours could be set as requested, and 0
 * otherwise.
 *
 * SDL_SetColors() is equivalent to calling this function with
 *     flags = (SDL_LOGPAL|SDL_PHYSPAL).
