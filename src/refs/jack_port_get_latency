<doc f='include/jack/jack.h' l='1023'>/** 
 * @return the time (in frames) between data being available or
 * delivered at/to a port, and the time at which it arrived at or is
 * delivered to the &quot;other side&quot; of the port.  E.g. for a physical
 * audio output port, this is the time between writing to the port and
 * when the signal will leave the connector.  For a physical audio
 * input port, this is the time between the sound arriving at the
 * connector and the corresponding frames being readable from the
 * port.
 *
 * @deprecated This method will be removed in the next major
 * release of JACK. It should not be used in new code, and should
 * be replaced by jack_port_get_latency_range() in any existing 
 * use cases.
