      // &quot;authenticator&quot; (optional) is used for access control.  If you have username and password strings, you can use this by
      //     passing an actual parameter that you created by creating an &quot;Authenticator(username, password) object&quot;.
      //     (Note that if you supply a non-NULL &quot;authenticator&quot; parameter, you need do this only for the first command you send.)</doc>
