 * Get multiple directory entries.
 *
 * smbc_getdents() reads as many dirent structures from the an open
 * directory handle into a specified memory area as will fit.
 *
 * @param dh        Valid directory as returned by smbc_opendir()
 *
 * @param dirp      pointer to buffer that will receive the directory
 *                  entries.
 *
 * @param count     The size of the dirp buffer in bytes
 *
 * @returns         If any dirents returned, return will indicate the
 *                  total size. If there were no more dirents available,
 *                  0 is returned. &lt; 0 indicates an error.
 *                  - EBADF  Invalid directory handle
 *                  - EINVAL Result buffer is too small or smbc_init
 *		    not called.
 *                  - ENOENT No such directory.
 * @see             , smbc_dirent, smbc_readdir(), smbc_open()
 *
 * @todo Are errno values complete and correct?
 *
 * @todo Add example code so people know how to parse buffers.
