 * Sets the clipping rectangle for the destination surface in a blit.
 *
 * If the clip rectangle is NULL, clipping will be disabled.
 * If the clip rectangle doesn&apos;t intersect the surface, the function will
 * return SDL_FALSE and blits will be completely clipped.  Otherwise the
 * function returns SDL_TRUE and blits to the surface will be clipped to
 * the intersection of the surface area and the clipping rectangle.
 *
 * Note that blits are automatically clipped to the edges of the source
 * and destination surfaces.
