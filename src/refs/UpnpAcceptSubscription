 * \brief Accepts a subscription request and sends out the current state of the
 * eventable variables for a service.
 *
 * The device application should call this function when it receives a
 * \c UPNP_EVENT_SUBSCRIPTION_REQUEST callback.
 *
 * This function is synchronous and generates no callbacks.
 *
 * This function can be called during the execution of a callback function.
 *
 * \return An integer representing one of the following:
 *      \li \c UPNP_E_SUCCESS: The operation completed successfully.
 *      \li \c UPNP_E_INVALID_HANDLE: The handle is not a valid device 
 *              handle.
 *      \li \c UPNP_E_INVALID_SERVICE: The \b DevId/\b ServId 
 *              pair refers to an invalid service. 
 *      \li \c UPNP_E_INVALID_SID: The specified subscription ID is not 
 *              valid.
 *      \li \c UPNP_E_INVALID_PARAM: Either \b VarName, 
 *              \b NewVal, \b DevID, or \b ServID is not a valid 
 *              pointer or \b cVariables is less than zero.
 *      \li \c UPNP_E_OUTOF_MEMORY: Insufficient resources exist to 
 *              complete this operation.
