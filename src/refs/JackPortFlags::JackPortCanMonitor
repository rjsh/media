      * if JackPortCanMonitor is set, then a call to
      * jack_port_request_monitor() makes sense.
      *
      * Precisely what this means is dependent on the client. A typical
      * result of it being called with TRUE as the second argument is
      * that data that would be available from an output port (with
      * JackPortIsPhysical set) is sent to a physical output connector
      * as well, so that it can be heard/seen/whatever.
      * 
      * Clients that do not control physical interfaces
      * should never create ports with this bit set.
