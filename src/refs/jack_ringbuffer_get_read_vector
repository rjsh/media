 * Fill a data structure with a description of the current readable
 * data held in the ringbuffer.  This description is returned in a two
 * element array of jack_ringbuffer_data_t.  Two elements are needed
 * because the data to be read may be split across the end of the
 * ringbuffer.
 *
 * The first element will always contain a valid @a len field, which
 * may be zero or greater.  If the @a len field is non-zero, then data
 * can be read in a contiguous fashion using the address given in the
 * corresponding @a buf field.
 *
 * If the second element has a non-zero @a len field, then a second
 * contiguous stretch of data can be read from the address given in
 * its corresponding @a buf field.
 *
 * @param rb a pointer to the ringbuffer structure.
 * @param vec a pointer to a 2 element array of jack_ringbuffer_data_t.
