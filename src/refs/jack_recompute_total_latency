<doc f='include/jack/jack.h' l='1053'>/**
 * Request a complete recomputation of a port&apos;s total latency. This
 * can be called by a client that has just changed the internal
 * latency of its port using  jack_port_set_latency
 * and wants to ensure that all signal pathways in the graph
 * are updated with respect to the values that will be returned
 * by  jack_port_get_total_latency. 
 * 
 * @return zero for successful execution of the request. non-zero
 *         otherwise.
 *
 * @deprecated This method will be removed in the next major
 * release of JACK. It should not be used in new code, and should
 * be replaced by jack_recompute_total_latencies() in any existing
 * use cases.
