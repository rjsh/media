 * When filling in the desired audio spec structure,
 * - &apos;desired-&gt;freq&apos; should be the desired audio frequency in samples-per-second.
 * - &apos;desired-&gt;format&apos; should be the desired audio format.
 * - &apos;desired-&gt;samples&apos; is the desired size of the audio buffer, in samples.
 *     This number should be a power of two, and may be adjusted by the audio
 *     driver to a value more suitable for the hardware.  Good values seem to
 *     range between 512 and 8096 inclusive, depending on the application and
 *     CPU speed.  Smaller values yield faster response time, but can lead
 *     to underflow if the application is doing heavy processing and cannot
 *     fill the audio buffer in time.  A stereo sample consists of both right
 *     and left channels in LR ordering.
 *     Note that the number of samples is directly related to time by the
 *     following formula:  ms = (samples*1000)/freq
 * - &apos;desired-&gt;size&apos; is the size in bytes of the audio buffer, and is
 *     calculated by SDL_OpenAudio().
 * - &apos;desired-&gt;silence&apos; is the value used to set the buffer to silence,
 *     and is calculated by SDL_OpenAudio().
 * - &apos;desired-&gt;callback&apos; should be set to a function that will be called
 *     when the audio device is ready for more data.  It is passed a pointer
 *     to the audio buffer, and the length in bytes of the audio buffer.
 *     This function usually runs in a separate thread, and so you should
 *     protect data structures that it accesses by calling SDL_LockAudio()
 *     and SDL_UnlockAudio() in your code.
 * - &apos;desired-&gt;userdata&apos; is passed as the first parameter to your callback
 *     function.
 *
 * @note The calculated values in this structure are calculated by SDL_OpenAudio()
