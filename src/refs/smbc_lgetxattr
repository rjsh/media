 * Get extended attributes for a file.  The POSIX function which this maps to
 * would act on a symbolic link rather than acting on what the symbolic link
 * points to, but with no symbolic links in SMB file systems, this function
 * is functionally identical to smbc_getxattr().
 *
 * @param url       The smb url of the file or directory to get extended
 *                  attributes for.
 *
 * @param name      The name of an attribute to be retrieved.  Names are of
 *                  one of the following forms:
 *
 *                     system.nt_sec_desc.&lt;attribute name&gt;
 *                     system.nt_sec_desc.*
 *                     system.nt_sec_desc.*+
 *
 *                  where &lt;attribute name&gt; is one of:
 *
 *                     revision
 *                     owner
 *                     owner+
 *                     group
 *                     group+
 *                     acl:&lt;name or sid&gt;
 *                     acl+:&lt;name or sid&gt;
 *
 *                  In the forms &quot;system.nt_sec_desc.*&quot; and
 *                  &quot;system.nt_sec_desc.*+&quot;, the asterisk and plus signs are
 *                  literal, i.e. the string is provided exactly as shown, and
 *                  the value parameter will return a complete security
 *                  descriptor with name:value pairs separated by tabs,
 *                  commas, or newlines (not spaces!).
 *
 *                  The plus sign (&apos;+&apos;) indicates that SIDs should be mapped
 *                  to names.  Without the plus sign, SIDs are not mapped;
 *                  rather they are simply converted to a string format.
 *
 * @param value     A pointer to a buffer in which the value of the specified
 *                  attribute will be placed (unless size is zero).
 *
 * @param size      The size of the buffer pointed to by value.  This parameter
 *                  may also be zero, in which case the size of the buffer
 *                  required to hold the attribute value will be returned,
 *                  but nothing will be placed into the value buffer.
 *
 * @return          0 on success, &lt; 0 on error with errno set:
 *                  - EINVAL  The client library is not properly initialized
 *                            or one of the parameters is not of a correct
 *                            form
 *                  - ENOMEM No memory was available for internal needs
 *                  - EEXIST  If the attribute already exists and the flag
 *                            SMBC_XATTR_FLAG_CREAT was specified
 *                  - ENOATTR If the attribute does not exist and the flag
 *                            SMBC_XATTR_FLAG_REPLACE was specified
 *                  - EPERM   Permission was denied.
 *                  - ENOTSUP The referenced file system does not support
 *                            extended attributes
 *
