<doc f='include/FLAC/stream_decoder.h' l='1474'>/** Decode until the end of the stream.
 *  This version instructs the decoder to decode from the current position
 *  and continue until the end of stream (the read callback returns
 *  \c FLAC__STREAM_DECODER_READ_STATUS_END_OF_STREAM), or until the
 *  callbacks return a fatal error.
 *
 *  As the decoder needs more input it will call the read callback.
 *  As each metadata block and frame is decoded, the metadata or write
 *  callback will be called with the decoded metadata or frame.
 *
 * \param  decoder  An initialized decoder instance.
 * \assert
 *    \code decoder != NULL \endcode
 * \retval FLAC__bool
 *    \c false if any fatal read, write, or memory allocation error
 *    occurred (meaning decoding must stop), else \c true; for more
 *    information about the decoder, check the decoder state with
 *    FLAC__stream_decoder_get_state().
