<doc f='include/jack/ringbuffer.h' l='139'>/**
 * Read data from the ringbuffer. Opposed to jack_ringbuffer_read()
 * this function does not move the read pointer. Thus it&apos;s
 * a convenient way to inspect data in the ringbuffer in a
 * continous fashion. The price is that the data is copied
 * into a user provided buffer. For &quot;raw&quot; non-copy inspection
 * of the data in the ringbuffer use jack_ringbuffer_get_read_vector().
 *
 * @param rb a pointer to the ringbuffer structure.
 * @param dest a pointer to a buffer where data read from the
 * ringbuffer will go.
 * @param cnt the number of bytes to read.
 *
 * @return the number of bytes read, which may range from 0 to cnt.
