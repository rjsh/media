 * \brief Searches for devices matching the given search target.
 *
 * The function returns immediately and the SDK calls the default callback
 * function, registered during the \b UpnpRegisterClient call, for each
 * matching root device, device, or service. The application specifies the
 * search type by the \b Target parameter.  
 *
 * This function searches for the devices for the provided maximum time.
 * It is an asynchronous function. It schedules a search job and returns. 
 * The client is notified about the search results after search timer.
 *
 * Note that there is no way for the SDK to distinguish which client
 * instance issued a particular search.  Therefore, the client can get
 * search callbacks that do not match the original criteria of the search.
 * Also, the application will receive multiple callbacks for each search.
 *
 * \return An integer representing one of the following:
 *     \li \c UPNP_E_SUCCESS: The operation completed successfully.
 *     \li \c UPNP_E_INVALID_HANDLE: The handle is not a valid control 
 *             point handle.
 *     \li \c UPNP_E_INVALID_PARAM: \b Target is \c NULL.
