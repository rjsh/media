 * Retrieve a disc record from the CDDB server.  This function
 * requires that the category and disc ID of the provided disc
 * structure are valid.
 *
 * If nothing goes wrong, the function will return 1 and the error
 * code will be reset to:
 * - #CDDB_ERR_OK:
 *     If everything went as planned.
 *
 * If there is a problem with reading data from the CDDB server one of
 * the following error codes will be set:
 * - #CDDB_ERR_DATA_MISSING:
 *     If some required data is missing from the given disc
 *     structure to execute this command.
 * - #CDDB_ERR_DISC_NOT_FOUND:
 *     If the requested disc is not known by the CDDB server.
 * - #CDDB_ERR_SERVER_ERROR:
 *     If the server encountered an error while trying to process your
 *     request.
 * - #CDDB_ERR_UNKNOWN:
 *     If the server specified an unknown response code.  Please
 *     report this as a libcddb bug.
 *
 * When there are problems with the connection to the CDDB server one
 * of the following error codes will be set:
 * - #CDDB_ERR_UNKNOWN_HOST_NAME:
 *     If there was an error when resolving the host name of the CDDB
 *     server.
 * - #CDDB_ERR_CONNECT:
 *     If a connection to the CDDB server could not be established.
 *     This can be due to incorrect data about the location of the
 *     server (host name, port).
 * - #CDDB_ERR_NOT_CONNECTED:
 *     If something when wrong in the process and you got
 *     disconnected.  Retrying might succeed (but no guarantees).
 * - #CDDB_ERR_PERMISSION_DENIED:
 *     If the server is up and running but denied the connection.
 *     This can occur when the server is too highly loaded or the
 *     handshake information (user name, ...) is considered to be
 *     invalid.
 *
 * @param c    The CDDB connection structure.
 * @param disc A non-null CDDB disc structure.
 * @return 1 on succes, 0 on failure
