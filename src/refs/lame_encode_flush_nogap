 * OPTIONAL:
 * lame_encode_flush_nogap will flush the internal mp3 buffers and pad
 * the last frame with ancillary data so it is a complete mp3 frame.
 *
 * &apos;mp3buf&apos; should be at least 7200 bytes long
 * to hold all possible emitted data.
 *
 * After a call to this routine, the outputed mp3 data is complete, but
 * you may continue to encode new PCM samples and write future mp3 data
 * to a different file.  The two mp3 files will play back with no gaps
 * if they are concatenated together.
 *
 * This routine will NOT write id3v1 tags into the bitstream.
 *
 * return code = number of bytes output to mp3buf. Can be 0
