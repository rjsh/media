     * Image data will be stored in a buffer of type VAImageBufferType to facilitate
     * data store on the server side for optimal performance. The buffer will be 
     * created by the CreateImage function, and proper storage allocated based on the image
     * size and format. This buffer is managed by the library implementation, and 
     * accessed by the client through the buffer Map/Unmap functions.
