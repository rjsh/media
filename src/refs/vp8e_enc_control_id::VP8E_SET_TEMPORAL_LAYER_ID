   *
   * For temporal scalability: this control allows the application to set the
   * layer id for each frame to be encoded. Note that this control must be set
   * for every frame prior to encoding. The usage of this control function
   * supersedes the internal temporal pattern counter, which is now deprecated.
   *
   * Supported in codecs: VP8
