 * \param _dec     A #th_dec_ctx handle.
 * \param _op      An &lt;tt&gt;ogg_packet&lt;/tt&gt; containing encoded video data.
 * \param _granpos Returns the granule position of the decoded packet.
 *                 If non-&lt;tt&gt;NULL&lt;/tt&gt;, the granule position for this specific
 *                  packet is stored in this location.
 *                 This is computed incrementally from previously decoded
 *                  packets.
 *                 After a seek, the correct granule position must be set via
 *                  #TH_DECCTL_SET_GRANPOS for this to work properly.
 * \retval 0             Success.
 *                       A new decoded frame can be retrieved by calling
 *                        th_decode_ycbcr_out().
 * \retval TH_DUPFRAME   The packet represented a dropped (0-byte) frame.
 *                       The player can skip the call to th_decode_ycbcr_out(),
 *                        as the contents of the decoded frame buffer have not
 *                        changed.
 * \retval TH_EFAULT     \a _dec or \a _op was &lt;tt&gt;NULL&lt;/tt&gt;.
 * \retval TH_EBADPACKET \a _op does not contain encoded video data.
 * \retval TH_EIMPL      The video data uses bitstream features which this
 *                        library does not support.*/</doc>
