 * raw1394_iso_recv_flush - flush all already received iso packets from kernel into user space
 * @handle: libraw1394 handle
 *
 * If you specified an irq_interval &gt; 1 in
 * iso_recv_init, you won&apos;t be notified for every single iso packet, but
 * for groups of them. Now e.g. if irq_interval is 100, and you were just
 * notified about iso packets and after them only 20 more packets arrived,
 * no notification will be generated (20 &lt; 100). In the case that you know
 * that there should be more packets at this moment, you can call this
 * function and all iso packets which are already received by the kernel
 * will be flushed out to user space.
 *
 * Returns: 0 on success or -1 on failure (sets errno)
