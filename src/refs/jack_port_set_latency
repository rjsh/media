<doc f='include/jack/jack.h' l='911'>/**
 * The port latency is zero by default. Clients that control
 * physical hardware with non-zero latency should call this
 * to set the latency to its correct value. Note that the value
 * should include any systemic latency present &quot;outside&quot; the
 * physical hardware controlled by the client. For example,
 * for a client controlling a digital audio interface connected
 * to an external digital converter, the latency setting should
 * include both buffering by the audio interface *and* the converter. 
 *
 * @deprecated This method will be removed in the next major
 * release of JACK. It should not be used in new code, and should
 * be replaced by a latency callback that calls @ref
 * jack_port_set_latency_range().
