 * \brief Registers a control point application with the UPnP Library.
 *
 * A control point application cannot make any other API calls until it
 * registers using this function.
 *
 * \b UpnpRegisterClient is a synchronous call and generates no callbacks.
 * Callbacks can occur as soon as this function returns.
 *
 * \return An integer representing one of the following:
 *      \li \c UPNP_E_SUCCESS: The operation completed successfully.
 *      \li \c UPNP_E_FINISH: The SDK is already terminated or 
 *                            is not initialized. 
 *      \li \c UPNP_E_INVALID_PARAM: Either \b Callback or \b Hnd 
 *              is not a valid pointer.
 *      \li \c UPNP_E_OUTOF_MEMORY: Insufficient resources exist to 
 *              register this control point.
