<doc f='include/samba-4.0/libsmbclient.h' l='1443'>/**@ingroup directory
 * Rename or move a file or directory.
 *
 * @param ourl      The original smb url (source url) of file or
 *                  directory to be moved
 *
 * @param nurl      The new smb url (destination url) of the file
 *                  or directory after the move.  Currently nurl must
 *                  be on the same share as ourl.
 *
 * @return          0 on success, &lt; 0 on error with errno set:
 *                  - EISDIR nurl is an existing directory, but ourl is
 *                  not a directory.
 *                  - EEXIST nurl is  a  non-empty directory,
 *                  i.e., contains entries other than &quot;.&quot; and &quot;..&quot;
 *                  - EINVAL The  new  url  contained  a path prefix
 *                  of the old, or, more generally, an  attempt was
 *                  made  to make a directory a subdirectory of itself
 *		    or smbc_init not called.
 *                  - ENOTDIR A component used as a directory in ourl
 *                  or nurl path is not, in fact, a directory.  Or,
 *                  ourl  is a directory, and newpath exists but is not
 *                  a directory.
 *                  - EACCES or EPERM Write access to the directory
 *                  containing ourl or nurl is not allowed for the
 *                  process&apos;s effective uid,  or  one of the
 *                  directories in ourl or nurl did not allow search
 *                  (execute) permission,  or ourl  was  a  directory
 *                  and did not allow write permission.
 *                  - ENOENT A  directory component in ourl or nurl
 *                  does not exist.
 *                  - EXDEV Rename across shares not supported.
 *                  - ENOMEM Insufficient kernel memory was available.
 *                  - EEXIST The target file, nurl, already exists.
 *
 *
 * @todo Are we going to support copying when urls are not on the same
 *       share?  I say no... NOTE. I agree for the moment.
