       * Save the file.  This will attempt to save all of the tag types that are
       * specified by OR-ing together TagTypes values.  The save() method above
       * uses AllTags.  This returns true if saving was successful.
       *
       * This strips all tags not included in the mask, but does not modify them
       * in memory, so later calls to save() which make use of these tags will
       * remain valid.  This also strips empty tags.
