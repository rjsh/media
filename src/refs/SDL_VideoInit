 * Initializes the video subsystem. Sets up a connection
 * to the window manager, etc, and determines the current video mode and
 * pixel format, but does not initialize a window or graphics mode.
 * Note that event handling is activated by this routine.

 * If you use both sound and video in your application, you need to call
 * SDL_Init() before opening the sound device, otherwise under Win32 DirectX,
 * you won&apos;t be able to set full-screen display modes.
