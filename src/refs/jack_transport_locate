 * Reposition the transport to a new frame number.
 *
 * May be called at any time by any client.  The new position takes
 * effect in two process cycles.  If there are @ref slowsyncclients 
 * &quot;slow-sync clients&quot; and the transport is already rolling, it will 
 * enter the ::JackTransportStarting state and begin invoking their @a
 * sync_callbacks until ready.  This function is realtime-safe.

 * @see jack_transport_reposition, jack_set_sync_callback

 * @param client the JACK client structure.
 * @param frame frame number of new transport position.
 *
 * @return 0 if valid request, non-zero otherwise.
