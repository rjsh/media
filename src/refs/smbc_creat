 * Create a file on an SMB server.
 *
 * Same as calling smbc_open() with flags = O_CREAT|O_WRONLY|O_TRUNC
 *
 * @param furl      The smb url of the file to be created
 *
 * @param mode      mode specifies the permissions to use if  a  new
 *                  file is created.  It  is  modified  by  the
 *                  process&apos;s umask in the usual way: the permissions
 *                  of the created file are (mode &amp; ~umask)
 *
 *                  NOTE, the above is not true. We are dealing with
 *                  an SMB server, which has no concept of a umask!
 *
 * @return          Valid file handle, &lt; 0 on error with errno set:
 *                  - ENOMEM  Out of memory
 *                  - EINVAL if an invalid parameter passed, like no
 *                  file, or smbc_init not called.
 *                  - EEXIST  pathname already exists and O_CREAT and
 *                  O_EXCL were used.
 *                  - EISDIR  pathname  refers  to  a  directory  and
 *                  the access requested involved writing.
 *                  - EACCES  The requested access to the file is not
 *                  allowed
 *                  - ENOENT  A directory component in pathname does
 *                  not exist.
 *                  - ENODEV The requested share does not exist.
 * @see             smbc_open()
