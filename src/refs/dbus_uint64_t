 * @typedef dbus_uint64_t
 *
 * A 64-bit unsigned integer on all platforms that support it.
 * If supported, #DBUS_HAVE_INT64 will be defined.
 *
 * C99 requires a 64-bit type and most likely all interesting
 * compilers support one. GLib for example flat-out requires
 * a 64-bit type.
 *
 * You probably want to just assume #DBUS_HAVE_INT64 is always defined.
