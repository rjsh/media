<doc f='include/groupsock/Groupsock.hh' l='91'>// By default, the destination address, port and ttl for
      // outgoing packets are those that were specified in
      // the constructor.  This works OK for multicast sockets,
      // but for unicast we usually want the destination port
      // number, at least, to be different from the source port.
      // (If a parameter is 0 (or ~0 for ttl), then no change made.)

  // As a special case, we also allow multiple destinations (addresses &amp; ports)
  // (This can be used to implement multi-unicast.)</doc>
