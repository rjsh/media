<doc f='include/vpx/vp8cx.h' l='384'>/*!\brief Codec control function to enable frame parallel decoding feature.
   *
   * VP9 has a bitstream feature to reduce decoding dependency between frames
   * by turning off backward update of probability context used in encoding
   * and decoding. This allows staged parallel processing of more than one
   * video frames in the decoder. This control function provides a mean to
   * turn this feature on or off for bitstreams produced by encoder.
   *
   * By default, this feature is off.
   *
   * Supported in codecs: VP9
