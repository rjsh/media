 * \brief Performs the same operation as \b UpnpSubscribe, but returns
 * immediately and calls the registered callback function when the operation
 * is complete.
 *
 * Note that many of the error codes for this function are returned in
 * the \b UpnpEventSubscribe structure. In those cases, the function
 * returns \c UPNP_E_SUCCESS and the appropriate error code will
 * be in the &lt;b&gt;UpnpEventSubscribe.ErrCode&lt;/b&gt; field in the \b Event
 * structure passed to the callback.
 *
 *  \return An integer representing one of the following:
 *      \li \c UPNP_E_SUCCESS: The operation completed successfully.
 *      \li \c UPNP_E_INVALID_HANDLE: The handle is not a valid control 
 *              point handle.
 *      \li \c UPNP_E_INVALID_URL: The \b PublisherUrl is not a valid 
 *              URL.
 *      \li \c UPNP_E_INVALID_PARAM: Either \b TimeOut or \b Fun or 
 *              \b PublisherUrl is not a valid pointer.
 *      \li \c UPNP_E_OUTOF_MEMORY: Insufficient resources exist to 
 *              complete this operation.
 *      \li \c UPNP_E_NETWORK_ERROR: A network error occured (returned in 
 *              the &lt;b&gt;UpnpEventSubscribe.ErrCode&lt;/b&gt; field as part of the 
 *              callback).
 *      \li \c UPNP_E_SOCKET_WRITE: An error or timeout occurred writing 
 *              to a socket (returned in the 
 *              &lt;b&gt;UpnpEventSubscribe.ErrCode&lt;/b&gt; field as part of the 
 *              callback).
 *      \li \c UPNP_E_SOCKET_READ: An error or timeout occurred reading 
 *              from a socket (returned in the 
 *              &lt;b&gt;UpnpEventSubscribe.ErrCode&lt;/b&gt; field as part of the 
 *              callback).
 *      \li \c UPNP_E_SOCKET_BIND: An error occurred binding the socket 
 *              (returned in the &lt;b&gt;UpnpEventSubscribe.ErrCode&lt;/b&gt; field as 
 *              part of the callback).
 *      \li \c UPNP_E_SOCKET_CONNECT: An error occurred connecting to 
 *              \b PublisherUrl (returned in the \b 
 *              UpnpEventSubscribe.ErrCode field as part of the callback).
 *      \li \c UPNP_E_OUTOF_SOCKET: An error occurred creating  the 
 *              socket (returned in the &lt;b&gt;UpnpEventSubscribe.ErrCode&lt;/b&gt; 
 *              field as part of the callback).
 *      \li \c UPNP_E_BAD_RESPONSE: An error occurred in response from 
 *              the publisher (returned in the \b 
 *              UpnpEventSubscribe.ErrCode field as part of the callback).
 *      \li \c UPNP_E_SUBSCRIBE_UNACCEPTED: The publisher refused 
 *              the subscription request (returned in the \b 
 *              UpnpEventSubscribe.ErrCode field as part of the callback).
