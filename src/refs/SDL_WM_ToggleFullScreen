<doc f='include/SDL/SDL_video.h' l='906'>/**
 * Toggle fullscreen mode without changing the contents of the screen.
 * If the display surface does not require locking before accessing
 * the pixel information, then the memory pointers will not change.
 *
 * If this function was able to toggle fullscreen mode (change from 
 * running in a window to fullscreen, or vice-versa), it will return 1.
 * If it is not implemented, or fails, it returns 0.
 *
 * The next call to SDL_SetVideoMode() will set the mode fullscreen
 * attribute based on the flags parameter - if SDL_FULLSCREEN is not
 * set, then the display will be windowed by default where supported.
 *
 * This is currently only implemented in the X11 video driver.
