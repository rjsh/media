<doc f='include/x264.h' l='907'>/* x264_encoder_intra_refresh:
 *      If an intra refresh is not in progress, begin one with the next P-frame.
 *      If an intra refresh is in progress, begin one as soon as the current one finishes.
 *      Requires that b_intra_refresh be set.
 *
 *      Useful for interactive streaming where the client can tell the server that packet loss has
 *      occurred.  In this case, keyint can be set to an extremely high value so that intra refreshes
 *      only occur when calling x264_encoder_intra_refresh.
 *
 *      In multi-pass encoding, if x264_encoder_intra_refresh is called differently in each pass,
 *      behavior is undefined.
 *
 *      Should not be called during an x264_encoder_encode. */</doc>
