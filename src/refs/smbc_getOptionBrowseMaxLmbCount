 * Get from how many local master browsers should the list of workgroups be
 * retrieved.  It can take up to 12 minutes or longer after a server becomes a
 * local master browser, for it to have the entire browse list (the list of
 * workgroups/domains) from an entire network.  Since a client never knows
 * which local master browser will be found first, the one which is found
 * first and used to retrieve a browse list may have an incomplete or empty
 * browse list.  By requesting the browse list from multiple local master
 * browsers, a more complete list can be generated.  For small networks (few
 * workgroups), it is recommended that this value be set to 0, causing the
 * browse lists from all found local master browsers to be retrieved and
 * merged.  For networks with many workgroups, a suitable value for this
 * variable is probably somewhere around 3. (Default: 3).
