 * Wrapper to work around the lack of mkstemp() on mingw.
 * Also, tries to create file in /tmp first, if possible.
 * *prefix can be a character constant; *filename will be allocated internally.
 * @return file descriptor of opened file (or negative value corresponding to an
 * AVERROR code on error)
 * and opened file name in **filename.
 * @note On very old libcs it is necessary to set a secure umask before
 *       calling this, av_tempfile() can&apos;t call umask itself as it is used in
 *       libraries and could interfere with the calling application.
 * @deprecated as fd numbers cannot be passed saftely between libs on some platforms
