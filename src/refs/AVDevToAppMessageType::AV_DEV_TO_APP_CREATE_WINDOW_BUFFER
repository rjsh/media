     * Create window buffer message.
     *
     * Device requests to create a window buffer. Exact meaning is device-
     * and application-dependent. Message is sent before rendering first
     * frame and all one-shot initializations should be done here.
     * Application is allowed to ignore preferred window buffer size.
     *
     * @note: Application is obligated to inform about window buffer size
     *        with AV_APP_TO_DEV_WINDOW_SIZE message.
     *
     * data: AVDeviceRect: preferred size of the window buffer.
     *       NULL: no preferred size of the window buffer.
