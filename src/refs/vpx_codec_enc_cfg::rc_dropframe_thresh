<doc f='include/vpx/vpx_encoder.h' l='423'>/*!\brief Temporal resampling configuration, if supported by the codec.
     *
     * Temporal resampling allows the codec to &quot;drop&quot; frames as a strategy to
     * meet its target data rate. This can cause temporal discontinuities in
     * the encoded video, which may appear as stuttering during playback. This
     * trade-off is often acceptable, but for many applications is not. It can
     * be disabled in these cases.
     *
     * Note that not all codecs support this feature. All vpx VPx codecs do.
     * For other codecs, consult the documentation for that algorithm.
     *
     * This threshold is described as a percentage of the target data buffer.
     * When the data buffer falls below this percentage of fullness, a
     * dropped frame is indicated. Set the threshold to zero (0) to disable
     * this feature.
