 *      copies the current internal set of parameters to the pointer provided
 *      by the caller.  useful when the calling application needs to know
 *      how x264_encoder_open has changed the parameters, or the current state
 *      of the encoder after multiple x264_encoder_reconfig calls.
 *      note that the data accessible through pointers in the returned param struct
 *      (e.g. filenames) should not be modified by the calling application. */</doc>
