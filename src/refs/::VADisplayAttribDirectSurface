     * this is a gettable only attribute. For some implementations that use the
     * hardware overlay, after PutSurface is called, the surface can not be    
     * re-used until after the subsequent PutSurface call. If this is the case 
     * then the value for this attribute will be set to 1 so that the client   
     * will not attempt to re-use the surface right after returning from a call
     * to PutSurface.
     *
     * Don&apos;t use it, use flag VASurfaceDisplaying of vaQuerySurfaceStatus since
     * driver may use overlay or GPU alternatively
