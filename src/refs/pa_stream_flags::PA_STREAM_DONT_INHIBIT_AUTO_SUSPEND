<doc f='include/pulse/def.h' l='282'>/**&lt; Enable compatibility mode for legacy clients that rely on a
     * &quot;classic&quot; hardware device fragment-style playback model. If
     * this option is set, the minreq value of the buffer metrics gets
     * a new meaning: instead of just specifying that no requests
     * asking for less new data than this value will be made to the
     * client it will also guarantee that requests are generated as
     * early as this limit is reached. This flag should only be set in
     * very few situations where compatibility with a fragment-based
     * playback model needs to be kept and the client applications
     * cannot deal with data requests that are delayed to the latest
     * moment possible. (Usually these are programs that use usleep()
     * or a similar call in their playback loops instead of sleeping
     * on the device itself.) Also see pa_buffer_attr. This option may
     * not be specified at the same time as
     * PA_STREAM_ADJUST_LATENCY. \since 0.9.12 */</doc>
