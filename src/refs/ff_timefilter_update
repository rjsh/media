 * Update the filter
 *
 * This function must be called in real time, at each process cycle.
 *
 * @param period the device cycle duration in clock_periods. For example, at
 * 44.1kHz and a buffer size of 512 frames, period = 512 when clock_period
 * was 1.0/44100, or 512/44100 if clock_period was 1.
 *
 * system_time, in seconds, should be the value of the system clock time,
 * at (or as close as possible to) the moment the device hardware interrupt
 * occurred (or any other event the device clock raises at the beginning of a
 * cycle).
 *
 * @return the filtered time, in seconds
