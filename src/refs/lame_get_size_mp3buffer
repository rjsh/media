  size (bytes) of mp3 data buffered, but not yet encoded.
  this is the number of bytes which would be output by a call to
  lame_encode_flush_nogap.  NOTE: lame_encode_flush() will return
  more bytes than this because it will encode the reamining buffered
  PCM samples before flushing the mp3 buffers.
