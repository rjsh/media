 * Request a new transport position.
 *
 * May be called at any time by any client.  The new position takes
 * effect in two process cycles.  If there are @ref slowsyncclients 
 * &quot;slow-sync clients&quot; and the transport is already rolling, it will 
 * enter the ::JackTransportStarting state and begin invoking their @a
 * sync_callbacks until ready.  This function is realtime-safe.
 *
 * @see jack_transport_locate, jack_set_sync_callback
 * 
 * @param client the JACK client structure.
 * @param pos requested new transport position. Fill pos-&gt;valid to specify 
 *   which fields should be taken into account. If you mark a set of fields
 *   as valid, you are expected to fill them all.
 *
 * @return 0 if valid request, EINVAL if position structure rejected.
