 * \brief Quantization table for JPEG decoding.
 *
 * This structure holds the complete quantization tables. This is an
 * aggregation of all quantization table (DQT) segments maintained by
 * the application. i.e. up to 4 quantization tables are stored in
 * there for baseline profile.
 *
 * The #load_quantization_table array can be used as a hint to notify
 * the VA driver implementation about which table(s) actually changed
 * since the last submission of this buffer.
