                                                  The afterburner is a type of analysis by synthesis algorithm which increases the
                                                  audio quality but also the required processing power. It is recommended to always
                                                  activate this if additional memory consumption and processing power consumption
                                                  is not a problem. If increased MHz and memory consumption are an issue then the MHz
                                                  and memory cost of this optional module need to be evaluated against the improvement
                                                  in audio quality on a case by case basis.
                                                  - 0: Disable afterburner (default).
                                                  - 1: Enable afterburner. */</doc>
