 * \brief Initializes the Linux SDK for UPnP Devices (IPv4 only).
 *
 * \deprecated Kept for backwards compatibility. Use UpnpInit2 for new
 * implementations or where IPv6 is required.
 *
 * This function must be called before any other API function can be called.
 * It should be called only once. Subsequent calls to this API return a
 * \c UPNP_E_INIT error code.
 *
 * Optionally, the application can specify a host IPv4 address (in the
 * case of a multi-homed configuration) and a port number to use for
 * all UPnP operations.  Since a port number can be used only by one
 * process, multiple processes using the SDK must specify
 * different port numbers.
 *
 * If unspecified, the SDK will use the first IPv4-capable adapter&apos;s IP address
 * and an arbitrary port.
 *
 * This call is synchronous.
 *
 * \return An integer representing one of the following:
 *     \li \c UPNP_E_SUCCESS: The operation completed successfully.
 *     \li \c UPNP_E_OUTOF_MEMORY: Insufficient resources exist 
 *             to initialize the SDK.
 *     \li \c UPNP_E_INIT: The SDK is already initialized. 
 *     \li \c UPNP_E_INIT_FAILED: The SDK initialization 
 *             failed for an unknown reason.
 *     \li \c UPNP_E_SOCKET_BIND: An error occurred binding a socket.
 *     \li \c UPNP_E_LISTEN: An error occurred listening to a socket.
 *     \li \c UPNP_E_OUTOF_SOCKET: An error ocurred creating a socket.
 *     \li \c UPNP_E_INTERNAL_ERROR: An internal error ocurred.
