  internal algorithm selection.  True quality is determined by the bitrate
  but this variable will effect quality by selecting expensive or cheap algorithms.
  quality=0..9.  0=best (very slow).  9=worst.
  recommended:  2     near-best quality, not too slow
                5     good quality, fast
                7     ok quality, really fast
