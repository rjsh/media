<doc f='include/liveMedia/RTCP.hh' l='61'>// Assigns a handler routine to be called if a &quot;BYE&quot; arrives.
      // The handler is called once only; for subsequent &quot;BYE&quot;s,
      // &quot;setByeHandler()&quot; would need to be called again.
      // If &quot;handleActiveParticipantsOnly&quot; is True, then the handler is called
      // only if the SSRC is for a known sender (if we have a &quot;RTPSource&quot;),
      // or if the SSRC is for a known receiver (if we have a &quot;RTPSink&quot;).
      // This prevents (for example) the handler for a multicast receiver being
      // called if some other multicast receiver happens to exit.
      // If &quot;handleActiveParticipantsOnly&quot; is False, then the handler is called
      // for any incoming RTCP &quot;BYE&quot;.
      // (To remove an existing &quot;BYE&quot; handler, call &quot;setByeHandler()&quot; again, with a &quot;handlerTask&quot; of NULL.)</doc>
