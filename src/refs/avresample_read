 * Read samples from the output FIFO.
 *
 * During conversion, if the user does not specify an output buffer or
 * specifies an output buffer that is smaller than what is needed, remaining
 * samples that are not written to the output are stored to an internal FIFO
 * buffer. This function can be used to read samples from that internal FIFO.

 * @param avr         audio resample context
 * @param output      output data pointers. May be NULL, in which case
 *                    nb_samples of data is discarded from output FIFO.
 * @param nb_samples  number of samples to read from the FIFO
 * @return            the number of samples written to output
