 * \brief Removes a subscription of a control point from a service previously
 * subscribed to using \b UpnpSubscribe or \b UpnpSubscribeAsync, generating
 * a callback when the operation is complete.
 *
 * Note that many of the error codes for this function are returned in
 * the \b UpnpEventSubscribe structure.  In those cases, the function
 * returns \c UPNP_E_SUCCESS and the appropriate error code will
 * be in the &lt;b&gt;UpnpEventSubscribe.ErrCode&lt;/b&gt; field in the \b Event
 * structure passed to the callback.
 *
 * \return An integer representing one of the following:
 *     \li \c UPNP_E_SUCCESS: The operation completed successfully.
 *     \li \c UPNP_E_INVALID_HANDLE: The handle is not a valid control 
 *             point handle.
 *     \li \c UPNP_E_INVALID_SID: The \b SubsId is not a valid SID.
 *     \li \c UPNP_E_INVALID_PARAM: \b Fun is not a valid callback 
 *             function pointer.
 *     \li \c UPNP_E_OUTOF_MEMORY: Insufficient resources exist to 
 *             complete this operation.
 *     \li \c UPNP_E_NETWORK_ERROR: A network error occured (returned in 
 *             the &lt;b&gt;UpnpEventSubscribe.ErrCode&lt;/b&gt; field as part of the 
 *             callback).
 *     \li \c UPNP_E_SOCKET_WRITE: An error or timeout occurred writing 
 *             to a socket (returned in the &lt;b&gt;UpnpEventSubscribe.ErrCode&lt;/b&gt;
 *             field as part of the callback).
 *     \li \c UPNP_E_SOCKET_READ: An error or timeout occurred reading 
 *             from a socket (returned in the 
 *             &lt;b&gt;UpnpEventSubscribe.ErrCode&lt;/b&gt; field as part of the 
 *             callback).
 *     \li \c UPNP_E_SOCKET_BIND: An error occurred binding the socket 
 *             (returned in the &lt;b&gt;UpnpEventSubscribe.ErrCode&lt;/b&gt; field as 
 *             part of the callback).
 *     \li \c UPNP_E_SOCKET_CONNECT: An error occurred connecting to 
 *             \b PublisherUrl (returned in the &lt;b&gt;UpnpEventSubscribe.ErrCode&lt;/b&gt;
 *             field as part of the callback).
 *     \li \c UPNP_E_OUTOF_SOCKET: An error occurred creating a socket (
 *             returned in the &lt;b&gt;UpnpEventSubscribe.ErrCode&lt;/b&gt; field as 
 *             part of the callback).
 *     \li \c UPNP_E_BAD_RESPONSE: An error occurred in response from 
 *             the publisher (returned in the &lt;b&gt;UpnpEventSubscribe.ErrCode&lt;/b&gt;
 *             field as part of the callback).
 *     \li \c UPNP_E_UNSUBSCRIBE_UNACCEPTED: The publisher refused 
 *             the subscription request (returned in the
 *             &lt;b&gt;UpnpEventSubscribe.ErrCode&lt;/b&gt; field as part of the callback).
