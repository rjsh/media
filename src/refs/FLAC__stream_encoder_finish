<doc f='include/FLAC/stream_encoder.h' l='1676'>/** Finish the encoding process.
 *  Flushes the encoding buffer, releases resources, resets the encoder
 *  settings to their defaults, and returns the encoder state to
 *  FLAC__STREAM_ENCODER_UNINITIALIZED.  Note that this can generate
 *  one or more write callbacks before returning, and will generate
 *  a metadata callback.
 *
 *  Note that in the course of processing the last frame, errors can
 *  occur, so the caller should be sure to check the return value to
 *  ensure the file was encoded properly.
 *
 *  In the event of a prematurely-terminated encode, it is not strictly
 *  necessary to call this immediately before FLAC__stream_encoder_delete()
 *  but it is good practice to match every FLAC__stream_encoder_init_*()
 *  with a FLAC__stream_encoder_finish().
 *
 * \param  encoder  An uninitialized encoder instance.
 * \assert
 *    \code encoder != NULL \endcode
 * \retval FLAC__bool
 *    \c false if an error occurred processing the last frame; or if verify
 *    mode is set (see FLAC__stream_encoder_set_verify()), there was a
 *    verify mismatch; else \c true.  If \c false, caller should check the
 *    state with FLAC__stream_encoder_get_state() for more information
 *    about the error.
