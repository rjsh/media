     * An AV_PKT_DATA_H263_MB_INFO side data packet contains a number of
     * structures with info about macroblocks relevant to splitting the
     * packet into smaller packets on macroblock edges (e.g. as for RFC 2190).
     * That is, it does not necessarily contain info about all macroblocks,
     * as long as the distance between macroblocks in the info is smaller
     * than the target payload size.
     * Each MB info structure is 12 bytes, and is laid out as follows:
     * @code
     * u32le bit offset from the start of the packet
     * u8    current quantizer at the start of the macroblock
     * u8    GOB number
     * u16le macroblock address within the GOB
     * u8    horizontal MV predictor
