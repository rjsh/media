 * \brief Macroblock parameter for H.264 encoding in baseline, main &amp; high 
 * profiles.
 *
 * This structure holds per-macroblock information. The buffer must be
 * allocated with as many elements (macroblocks) as necessary to fit
 * the slice to be encoded. Besides, the per-macroblock records must
 * be written in a strict raster order and with no gap. i.e. every
 * macroblock, regardless of its type, shall have an entry.
