 * Open a file on an SMB server.
 *
 * @param furl      The smb url of the file to be opened.
 *
 * @param flags     Is one of O_RDONLY, O_WRONLY or O_RDWR which
 *                  request opening  the  file  read-only,write-only
 *                  or read/write. flags may also be bitwise-or&apos;d with
 *                  one or  more of  the following:
 *                  O_CREAT - If the file does not exist it will be
 *                  created.
 *                  O_EXCL - When  used with O_CREAT, if the file
 *                  already exists it is an error and the open will
 *                  fail.
 *                  O_TRUNC - If the file already exists it will be
 *                  truncated.
 *                  O_APPEND The  file  is  opened  in  append mode
 *
 * @param mode      mode specifies the permissions to use if a new
 *                  file is created.  It  is  modified  by  the
 *                  process&apos;s umask in the usual way: the permissions
 *                  of the created file are (mode &amp; ~umask)
 *
 *                  Not currently use, but there for future use.
 *                  We will map this to SYSTEM, HIDDEN, etc bits
 *                  that reverses the mapping that smbc_fstat does.
 *
 * @return          Valid file handle, &lt; 0 on error with errno set:
 *                  - ENOMEM  Out of memory
 *                  - EINVAL if an invalid parameter passed, like no
 *                  file, or smbc_init not called.
 *                  - EEXIST  pathname already exists and O_CREAT and
 *                  O_EXCL were used.
 *                  - EISDIR  pathname  refers  to  a  directory  and
 *                  the access requested involved writing.
 *                  - EACCES  The requested access to the file is not
 *                  allowed
 *                  - ENODEV The requested share does not exist
 *                  - ENOTDIR A file on the path is not a directory
 *                  - ENOENT  A directory component in pathname does
 *                  not exist.
 *
 * @see             smbc_creat()
 *
 * @note            This call uses an underlying routine that may create
 *                  a new connection to the server specified in the URL.
 *                  If the credentials supplied in the URL, or via the
 *                  auth_fn in the smbc_init call, fail, this call will
 *                  try again with an empty username and password. This
 *                  often gets mapped to the guest account on some machines.
