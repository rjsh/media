<doc f='include/theora/codec.h' l='283'>/**The amount to shift to extract the last keyframe number from the granule
   *  position.
   * This can be at most 31.
   * th_info_init() will set this to a default value (currently &lt;tt&gt;6&lt;/tt&gt;,
   *  which is good for streaming applications), but you can set it to 0 to
   *  make every frame a keyframe.
   * The maximum distance between key frames is
   *  &lt;tt&gt;1&lt;&lt;#keyframe_granule_shift&lt;/tt&gt;.
   * The keyframe frequency can be more finely controlled with
   *  #TH_ENCCTL_SET_KEYFRAME_FREQUENCY_FORCE, which can also be adjusted
   *  during encoding (for example, to force the next frame to be a keyframe),
   *  but it cannot be set larger than the amount permitted by this field after
   *  the headers have been output.*/</doc>
