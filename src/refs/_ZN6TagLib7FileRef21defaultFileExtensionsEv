     * As is mentioned elsewhere in this class&apos;s documentation, the default file
     * type resolution code provided by TagLib only works by comparing file
     * extensions.
     *
     * This method returns the list of file extensions that are used by default.
     *
     * The extensions are all returned in lowercase, though the comparison used
     * by TagLib for resolution is case-insensitive.
     *
     * \note This does not account for any additional file type resolvers that
     * are plugged in.  Also note that this is not intended to replace a propper
     * mime-type resolution system, but is just here for reference.
     *
     * \see FileTypeResolver
