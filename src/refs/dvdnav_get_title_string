 * Return a string describing the title of the DVD.
 * This is an ID string encoded on the disc by the author. In many cases
 * this is a descriptive string such as `THE_MATRIX&apos; but sometimes is singularly
 * uninformative such as `PDVD-011421&apos;. Some DVD authors even forget to set this,
 * so you may also read the default of the authoring software they used, like
 * `DVDVolume&apos;.
