     * playback before at least prebuf bytes are available in the
     * buffer. It is recommended to set this to (uint32_t) -1, which
     * will initialize this to the same value as tlength, whatever
     * that may be. Initialize to 0 to enable manual start/stop
     * control of the stream. This means that playback will not stop
     * on underrun and playback will not start automatically. Instead
     * pa_stream_cork() needs to be called explicitly. If you set
     * this value to 0 you should also set PA_STREAM_START_CORKED. */</doc>
