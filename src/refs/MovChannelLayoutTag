 * Channel Layout Tag
 * This tells which channels are present in the audio stream and the order in
 * which they appear.
 *
 * @note We&apos;re using the channel layout tag to indicate channel order
 *       when the value is greater than 0x10000. The Apple documentation has
 *       some contradictions as to how this is actually supposed to be handled.
 *
 *       Core Audio File Format Spec:
 *           &quot;The high 16 bits indicates a specific ordering of the channels.&quot;
 *       Core Audio Data Types Reference:
 *           &quot;These identifiers specify the channels included in a layout but
 *            do not specify a particular ordering of those channels.&quot;
