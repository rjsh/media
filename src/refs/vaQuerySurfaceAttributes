 * \brief Queries surface attributes for the supplied config.
 *
 * Unlike vaGetSurfaceAttributes(), this function queries for all
 * supported attributes for the supplied VA @config. In particular, if
 * the underlying hardware supports the creation of VA surfaces in
 * various formats, then this function will enumerate all pixel
 * formats that are supported.
 *
 * The \c attrib_list array is allocated by the user and \c
 * num_attribs shall be initialized to the number of allocated
 * elements in that array. Upon successful return, the actual number
 * of attributes will be overwritten into \c num_attribs. Otherwise,
 * \c VA_STATUS_ERROR_MAX_NUM_EXCEEDED is returned and \c num_attribs
 * is adjusted to the number of elements that would be returned if
 * enough space was available.
 *
 * Note: it is perfectly valid to pass NULL to the \c attrib_list
 * argument when vaQuerySurfaceAttributes() is used to determine the
 * actual number of elements that need to be allocated.
 *
 * @param[in] dpy               the VA display
 * @param[in] config            the config identifying a codec or a video
 *     processing pipeline
 * @param[out] attrib_list      the output array of #VASurfaceAttrib elements
 * @param[in,out] num_attribs   the number of elements allocated on
 *      input, the number of elements actually filled in output
