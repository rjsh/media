 * \brief Similar to \b UpnpNotify except that it takes a DOM document for the
 * event rather than an array of strings.
 *
 * This function is synchronous and generates no callbacks.
 *
 * This function may be called during a callback function to send out a
 * notification.
 *
 * \return An integer representing one of the following:
 *     \li \c UPNP_E_SUCCESS: The operation completed successfully.
 *     \li \c UPNP_E_INVALID_HANDLE: The handle is not a valid device 
 *             handle.
 *     \li \c UPNP_E_INVALID_SERVICE: The \b DevId/\b ServId 
 *             pair refers to an invalid service.
 *     \li \c UPNP_E_INVALID_PARAM: Either \b VarName, \b NewVal, 
 *              \b DevID, \b ServID, or \b PropSet 
 *              is not a valid pointer or \b cVariables is less than zero.
 *     \li \c UPNP_E_OUTOF_MEMORY: Insufficient resources exist to 
 *             complete this operation.
