 * document for the variables to event rather than an array of strings.

 *
 * \return An integer representing one of the following:
 *     \li \c UPNP_E_SUCCESS: The operation completed successfully.
 *     \li \c UPNP_E_INVALID_HANDLE: The handle is not a valid device 
 *             handle.
 *     \li \c UPNP_E_INVALID_SERVICE: The \b DevId/\b ServId 
 *             pair refers to an invalid service. 
 *     \li \c UPNP_E_INVALID_SID: The specified subscription ID is not 
 *             valid.
 *     \li \c UPNP_E_INVALID_PARAM: Either \b VarName,  
 *             \b NewVal, \b DevID, \b ServID, or \b PropSet
