 * the service data you received via avahi_service_browser_new()&apos;s
 * callback function, especially interface and protocol. The protocol
 * argument specifies the protocol (IPv4 or IPv6) to use as transport
 * for the queries which are sent out by this resolver. The
 * aprotocol argument specifies the adress family (IPv4 or IPv6) of
 * the address of the service we are looking for. Generally, on
 * &quot;protocol&quot; you should only pass what was supplied to you as
 * parameter to your AvahiServiceBrowserCallback. In &quot;aprotocol&quot; you
 * should pass what your application code can deal with when
 * connecting to the service. Or, more technically speaking: protocol
 * specifies if the mDNS queries should be sent as UDP/IPv4
 * resp. UDP/IPv6 packets. aprotocol specifies whether the query is for a A
 * resp. AAAA resource record. */</doc>
