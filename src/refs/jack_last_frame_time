 * @return the precise time at the start of the current process cycle.
 * This function may only be used from the process callback, and can
 * be used to interpret timestamps generated by jack_frame_time() in
 * other threads with respect to the current process cycle.
 * 
 * This is the only jack time function that returns exact time:
 * when used during the process callback it always returns the same
 * value (until the next process callback, where it will return
 * that value + nframes, etc).  The return value is guaranteed to be
 * monotonic and linear in this fashion unless an xrun occurs.
 * If an xrun occurs, clients must check this value again, as time
 * may have advanced in a non-linear way (e.g. cycles may have been skipped).
