 * \brief Queries video processing filters.
 *
 * This function returns the list of video processing filters supported
 * by the driver. The \c filters array is allocated by the user and
 * \c num_filters shall be initialized to the number of allocated
 * elements in that array. Upon successful return, the actual number
 * of filters will be overwritten into \c num_filters. Otherwise,
 * \c VA_STATUS_ERROR_MAX_NUM_EXCEEDED is returned and \c num_filters
 * is adjusted to the number of elements that would be returned if enough
 * space was available.
 *
 * The list of video processing filters supported by the driver shall
 * be ordered in the way they can be iteratively applied. This is needed
 * for both correctness, i.e. some filters would not mean anything if
 * applied at the beginning of the pipeline; but also for performance
 * since some filters can be applied in a single pass (e.g. noise
 * reduction + deinterlacing).
 *
 * @param[in] dpy               the VA display
 * @param[in] context           the video processing context
 * @param[out] filters          the output array of #VAProcFilterType elements
 * @param[in,out] num_filters the number of elements allocated on input,
 *      the number of elements actually filled in on output
