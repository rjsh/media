 * you must make sure to access the event loop object
 * (AvahiThreadedPoll, AvahiPoll and all its associated objects)
 * synchronized, i.e. with proper locking. You may want to use
 * avahi_threaded_poll_lock()/avahi_threaded_poll_unlock() for this,
 * which will lock the the entire event loop. Please note that event
 * loop callback functions are called from the event loop helper thread
 * with that lock held, i.e. avahi_threaded_poll_lock() calls are not
 * required from event callbacks. \since 0.6.4 */</doc>
