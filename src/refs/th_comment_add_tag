 * \note Neither th_comment_add() nor th_comment_add_tag() support
 *  comments containing null values, although the bitstream format does

 * To add such comments you will need to manipulate the #th_comment
 *  structure directly.
 * \param _tc  The #th_comment struct to add the comment to.
 * \param _tag A null-terminated string containing the tag  associated with
 *              the comment.
 * \param _val The corresponding value as a null-terminated string.*/</doc>
