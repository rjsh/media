     * Checks for a partial match of \a pattern at the end of the vector.  It
     * returns the offset of the partial match within the vector, or -1 if the
     * pattern is not found.  This method is particularly useful when searching for
     * patterns that start in one vector and end in another.  When combined with
     * startsWith() it can be used to find a pattern that overlaps two buffers.
     *
     * \note This will not match the complete pattern at the end of the string; use
     * endsWith() for that.
