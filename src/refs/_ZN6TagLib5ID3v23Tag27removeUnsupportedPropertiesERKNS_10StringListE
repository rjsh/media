       * Removes unsupported frames given by \a properties. The elements of
       * \a properties must be taken from properties().unsupportedData(); they
       * are of one of the following forms:
       *  - a four-character frame ID, if the ID3 specification allows only one
       *    frame with that ID (thus, the frame is uniquely determined)
       *  - frameID + &quot;/&quot; + description(), when the ID is one of &quot;TXXX&quot;, &quot;WXXX&quot;,
       *    &quot;COMM&quot;, or &quot;USLT&quot;,
       *  - &quot;UNKNOWN/&quot; + frameID, for frames that could not be parsed by TagLib.
       *    In that case, *all* unknown frames with the given ID will be removed.
