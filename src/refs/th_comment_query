 * \param _tc    An initialized #th_comment structure.
 * \param _tag   The tag to look up.
 * \param _count The instance of the tag.
 *               The same tag can appear multiple times, each with a distinct
 *                value, so an index is required to retrieve them all.
 *               The order in which these values appear is significant and
 *                should be preserved.
 *               Use th_comment_query_count() to get the legal range for
 *                the \a _count parameter.
 * \return A pointer to the queried tag&apos;s value.
 *         This points directly to data in the #th_comment structure.
 *         It should not be modified or freed by the application, and
 *          modifications to the structure may invalidate the pointer.
 * \retval NULL If no matching tag is found.*/</doc>
