 * \brief Coded buffer segment.
 *
 * #VACodedBufferSegment is an element of a linked list describing
 * some information on the coded buffer. The coded buffer segment
 * could contain either a single NAL unit, or more than one NAL unit. 
 * It is recommended (but not required) to return a single NAL unit 
 * in a coded buffer segment, and the implementation should set the 
 * VA_CODED_BUF_STATUS_SINGLE_NALU status flag if that is the case.
