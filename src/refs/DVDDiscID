 * This is the MD5 sum of VIDEO_TS.IFO and the VTS_0?_0.IFO files
 * in title order (those that exist).
 * If you need a &apos;text&apos; representation of the id, print it as a
 * hexadecimal number, using lowercase letters, discid[0] first.
 * I.e. the same format as the command-line &apos;md5sum&apos; program uses.
