     * option is enabled, pa_stream_get_time() will not necessarily
     * return always monotonically increasing time values on each

     * going &apos;backwards&apos;, but has the advantage that bad transport
     * latency estimations that caused the time to to jump ahead can
     * be corrected quickly, without the need to wait. (Please note
     * that this flag was named PA_STREAM_NOT_MONOTONOUS in releases
     * prior to 0.9.11. The old name is still defined too, for
     * compatibility reasons. */</doc>
