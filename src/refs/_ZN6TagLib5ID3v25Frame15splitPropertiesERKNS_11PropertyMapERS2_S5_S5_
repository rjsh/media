       * This helper function splits the PropertyMap \a original into three ProperytMaps

       * - \a singleFrameProperties contains only of keys which can be represented with
       *   exactly one ID3 frame per key. In the current implementation
       *   this is everything except for the fixed &quot;involved people&quot; keys and keys of the
       *   form &quot;TextIdentificationFrame::instrumentPrefix&quot; + &quot;instrument&quot;, which are
       *   mapped to a TMCL frame.
       * - \a tiplProperties will consist of those keys that are present in
       *   TextIdentificationFrame::involvedPeopleMap()
       * - \a tmclProperties contains the &quot;musician credits&quot; keys which should be mapped
