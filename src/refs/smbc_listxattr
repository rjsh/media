 * List the supported extended attribute names associated with a file
 *
 * @param url       The smb url of the file or directory to list the extended
 *                  attributes for.
 *
 * @param list      A pointer to a buffer in which the list of attributes for
 *                  the specified file or directory will be placed (unless
 *                  size is zero).
 *
 * @param size      The size of the buffer pointed to by list.  This parameter
 *                  may also be zero, in which case the size of the buffer
 *                  required to hold all of the attribute names will be
 *                  returned, but nothing will be placed into the list buffer.
 *
 * @return          0 on success, &lt; 0 on error with errno set:
 *                  - EINVAL The client library is not properly initialized
 *                  - ENOMEM No memory was available for internal needs
 *                  - EPERM  Permission was denied.
 *                  - ENOTSUP The referenced file system does not support
 *                            extended attributes
 *
 * @note            This function always returns all attribute names supported
 *                  by NT file systems, regardless of whether the referenced
 *                  file system supports extended attributes (e.g. a Windows
 *                  2000 machine supports extended attributes if NTFS is used,
 *                  but not if FAT is used, and Windows 98 doesn&apos;t support
 *                  extended attributes at all.  Whether this is a feature or
 *                  a bug is yet to be decided.
