Function name:

    DtsFormatChange

Description:

    Changes codec type and parameters.

    The device must have been previously opened for this call to succeed.
    This function should be used only for mid-stream format changes.
    DtsStartDecoder must have been called before for this function to succeed.

Parameters:

    hDevice     Handle to device. This is obtained via a prior call to
                DtsDeviceOpen.
    videoAlg    Video Codec to be enabled to decode stream.
                H.264 (0), VC-1 (4) and MPEG-2 (1) currently supported. All
                other values will return BC_STS_INV_ARG
    FGTEnable   Enable processing of FGT SEI.
    Progressive Instruct decoder to always try to send back progressive
                frames. If input content is 1080p, the decoder will ignore
                pull-down flags and always give 1080p output. If 1080i
                content is processed, the decoder will return 1080i data.
                When this flag is not set, the decoder will use pull-down
                information in the input stream to decide the decoded data
                format.
    Reserved    This field is reserved for possible future expansion.
                Set to 0.

Return:

    BC_STS_SUCCESS will be returned on successful completion.
