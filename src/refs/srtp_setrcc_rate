<doc f='vlc/modules/access/rtp/srtp.c' l='364'>/**
 * Sets Roll-over-Counter Carry (RCC) rate for the SRTP session. If not
 * specified (through this function), the default rate of ONE is assumed
 * (i.e. every RTP packets will carry the RoC). RCC rate is ignored if none
 * of the RCC mode has been selected.
 *
 * The RCC mode is selected through one of these flags for srtp_create():
 *  SRTP_RCC_MODE1: integrity protection only for RoC carrying packets
 *  SRTP_RCC_MODE2: integrity protection for all packets
 *  SRTP_RCC_MODE3: no integrity protection
 *
 * RCC mode 3 is insecure. Compared to plain RTP, it provides confidentiality
 * (through encryption) but is much more prone to DoS. It can only be used if
 * anti-spoofing protection is provided by lower network layers (e.g. IPsec,
 * or trusted routers and proper source address filtering).
 *
 * If RCC rate is 1, RCC mode 1 and 2 are functionally identical.
 *
 * @param rate RoC Carry rate (MUST NOT be zero)
