     * Type of multithreading being allowed/used. A combination of
     * AVFILTER_THREAD_* flags.
     *
     * May be set by the caller before initializing the filter to forbid some
     * or all kinds of multithreading for this filter. The default is allowing
     * everything.
     *
     * When the filter is initialized, this field is combined using bit AND with
     * AVFilterGraph.thread_type to get the final mask used for determining
     * allowed threading types. I.e. a threading type needs to be set in both
     * to be allowed.
     *
     * After the filter is initialized, libavfilter sets this field to the
     * threading type that is actually used (0 for no multithreading).
