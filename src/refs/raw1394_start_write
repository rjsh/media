 * raw1394_start_write - initiate a write transaction
 * @handle: libraw1394 handle
 * @node: target node ID
 * @addr: address to write to
 * @length: amount of bytes of data to write
 * @data: pointer to data to be sent
 * @tag: data to identify the request to completion handler
 *
 * This function starts the specified write request. If
 * @length is %4 a quadlet write is initiated and a block write otherwise.
 *
 * The transaction is only started, no success of the transaction is implied
 * with a successful return of this function.  When the transaction completes, a
 * raw1394_loop_iterate() will call the tag handler and pass it the tag and
 * error code of the transaction.  @tag should therefore be set to something
 * that uniquely identifies this transaction (e.g. a struct pointer casted to
 * unsigned long).
 *
 * Returns: &gt;= 0 on success or -1 on failure (sets errno)
