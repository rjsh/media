 * A histogram is an array of HIST_SIZE hist_entry storing all the energies
 * recorded (with an accuracy of 1/HIST_GRAIN) of the loudnesses from ABS_THRES
 * (at 0) to ABS_UP_THRES (at HIST_SIZE-1).
 * This fixed-size system avoids the need of a list of energies growing
 * infinitely over the time and is thus more scalable.
