 * raw1394_arm_register - register an address range mapping
 * @handle: libraw1394 handle
 * @start:            identifies address range
 * @length:           identifies address range
 * @initial_value:    pointer to buffer containing (if necessary) initial value
 *                    NULL means undefined
 * @arm_tag:          identifier for arm_tag_handler
 *                    (usually pointer to raw1394_arm_reqhandle)
 * @access_rights:    access-rights for registered address range handled
 *                    by kernel-part. Value is one or more binary or of the
 *                    following flags - ARM_READ, ARM_WRITE, ARM_LOCK
 * @notification_options: identifies for which type of request you want
 *                    to be notified. Value is one or more binary or of the
 *                    following flags - ARM_READ, ARM_WRITE, ARM_LOCK
 * @client_transactions: identifies for which type of request you want
 *                    to handle the request by the client application.
 *                    for those requests no response will be generated, but
 *                    has to be generated by the application.
 *                    Value is one or more binary or of the
 *                    following flags - ARM_READ, ARM_WRITE, ARM_LOCK
 *                    For each bit set here, notification_options and
 *                    access_rights will be ignored.
 *
 * ARM = Adress Range Mapping
 *
 * Returns: 0 on success or -1 on failure (sets errno)
