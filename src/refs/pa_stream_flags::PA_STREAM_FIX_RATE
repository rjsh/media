     * connected to, and possibly ignore the format the sample spec
     * contains -- but you still have to pass a valid value in it as a
     * hint to PulseAudio what would suit your stream best. If this is
     * used you should query the used sample format after creating the
     * stream by using pa_stream_get_sample_spec(). Also, if you
     * specified manual buffer metrics it is recommended to update
     * them with pa_stream_set_buffer_attr() to compensate for the
     * changed frame sizes. Only supported when the server is at least
     * PA 0.9.8. It is ignored on older servers. \since 0.9.8 */</doc>
