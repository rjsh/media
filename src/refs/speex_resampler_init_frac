 * @param nb_channels Number of channels to be processed
 * @param ratio_num Numerator of the sampling rate ratio
 * @param ratio_den Denominator of the sampling rate ratio
 * @param in_rate Input sampling rate rounded to the nearest integer (in Hz).
 * @param out_rate Output sampling rate rounded to the nearest integer (in Hz).
 * @param quality Resampling quality between 0 and 10, where 0 has poor quality
 * and 10 has very high quality.
 * @return Newly created resampler state
 * @retval NULL Error: not enough memory
