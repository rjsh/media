 * raw1394_get_speed - get maximum speed between a node and local node
 * @handle: libraw1394 handle
 * @node: node ID
 *
 * Returns: The speed code of the maximum possible transmission speed between
 * the node and the local node, taking both link speeds and all intermediate
 * phy speeds into account.  On error, returns -1 and sets errno.
 *
 * Bugs: Like much of the rest of the libraw1394 API, this call is prone to
 * races with bus resets.
 *
 * History: New function in libraw1394 v2.1.0.
