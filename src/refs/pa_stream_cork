<doc f='include/pulse/stream.h' l='641'>/** Pause (or resume) playback of this stream temporarily. Available
 * on both playback and recording streams. If \a b is 1 the stream is
 * paused. If \a b is 0 the stream is resumed. The pause/resume operation
 * is executed as quickly as possible. If a cork is very quickly
 * followed by an uncork or the other way round, this might not
 * actually have any effect on the stream that is output. You can use
 * pa_stream_is_corked() to find out whether the stream is currently
 * paused or not. Normally a stream will be created in uncorked
 * state. If you pass PA_STREAM_START_CORKED as a flag when connecting
 * the stream, it will be created in corked state. */</doc>
