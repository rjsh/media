<doc f='include/jack/jack.h' l='676'>/**
 * @return a null-terminated array of full port names to which the @a
 * port is connected.  If none, returns NULL.
 *
 * The caller is responsible for calling jack_free(3) on any non-NULL
 * returned value.
 *
 * This differs from jack_port_get_connections() in two important
 * respects:
 *
 *     1) You may not call this function from code that is
 *          executed in response to a JACK event. For example,
 *          you cannot use it in a GraphReordered handler.
 *
 *     2) You need not be the owner of the port to get information
 *          about its connections.
