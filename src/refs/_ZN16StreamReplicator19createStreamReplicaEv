    //   all replicas have been deleted.  (In this case, you must *not* call &quot;Medium::close()&quot; on the &quot;StreamReplicator&quot; object,
    //   unless you never created any replicas from it to begin with.)
    // If &quot;deleteWhenLastReplicaDies&quot; is False, then the &quot;StreamReplicator&quot; object remains in existence, even when all replicas
    //   have been deleted.  (This allows you to create new replicas later, if you wish.)  In this case, you delete the
    //   &quot;StreamReplicator&quot; object by calling &quot;Medium::close()&quot; on it - but you must do so only when &quot;numReplicas()&quot; returns 0.</doc>
