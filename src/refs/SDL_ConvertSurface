 * Creates a new surface of the specified format, and then copies and maps 
 * the given surface to it so the blit of the converted surface will be as 
 * fast as possible.  If this function fails, it returns NULL.
 *
 * The &apos;flags&apos; parameter is passed to SDL_CreateRGBSurface() and has those 
 * semantics.  You can also pass SDL_RLEACCEL in the flags parameter and
 * SDL will try to RLE accelerate colorkey and alpha blits in the resulting
 * surface.

 * This function is used internally by SDL_DisplayFormat().
