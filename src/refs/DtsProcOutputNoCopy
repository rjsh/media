Function name:

    DtsProcOutputNoCopy

Description:

    Returns one decoded picture to the caller. Functionality of this API()
    is very similar to ProcOutPut() API. This API will not copy the video data
    to caller&apos;s buffers but provides the source buffer pointers in pOut structure.

    This is more secure and preferred method for BCM&apos;s Link hardware. The actual
    format conversion/copy routines are provided as part of the Filter/Security
    layer source code. Using this method, all the clear data handling will be
    done by bcmDFilter or bcmSec layers which are expected to be in Player&apos;s
    tamper resistant area.

    == NOTE ====
     1) DtsReleaseOutputBuffs() interface must be called to release the buffers
        back to DIL if return Status is BC_STS_SUCCESS.

     2) Only this interface supports PIB and full 100% output encryption/Scrambling.


    The device must have been previously opened for this call to succeed.

Parameters:

    hDevice         Handle to device. This is obtained via a prior call to
                    DtsDeviceOpen.
    milliSecWait    Timeout parameter. DtsProcOoutput will fail is no picture
                    is received in this time.
    *pOut           This is a pointer to the BC_DTS_PROC_OUT structure that is
                    allocated by the caller. The decoded picture is returned
                    in this structure.

Return:

    BC_STS_SUCCESS will be returned on successful completion.
