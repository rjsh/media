<doc f='include/theora/codec.h' l='268'>/*Currently this is set so that a qi of 0 corresponds to distortions of 24
     times the JND, and each increase by 16 halves that value.
    This gives us fine discrimination at low qualities, yet effective rate
     control at high qualities.
    The qi value 63 is special, however.
    For this, the highest quality, we use one half of a JND for our threshold.
    Due to the lower bounds placed on allowable quantizers in Theora, we will
     not actually be able to achieve quality this good, but this should
     provide as close to visually lossless quality as Theora is capable of.
    We could lift the quantizer restrictions without breaking VP3.1
     compatibility, but this would result in quantized coefficients that are
     too large for the current bitstream to be able to store.
    We&apos;d have to redesign the token syntax to store these large coefficients,
     which would make transcoding complex.*/</doc>
