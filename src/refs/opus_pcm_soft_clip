<doc f='include/opus/opus.h' l='596'>/** Applies soft-clipping to bring a float signal within the [-1,1] range. If
  * the signal is already in that range, nothing is done. If there are values
  * outside of [-1,1], then the signal is clipped as smoothly as possible to
  * both fit in the range and avoid creating excessive distortion in the
  * process.
  * @param [in,out] pcm &lt;tt&gt;float*&lt;/tt&gt;: Input PCM and modified PCM
  * @param [in] frame_size &lt;tt&gt;int&lt;/tt&gt; Number of samples per channel to process
  * @param [in] channels &lt;tt&gt;int&lt;/tt&gt;: Number of channels
  * @param [in,out] softclip_mem &lt;tt&gt;float*&lt;/tt&gt;: State memory for the soft clipping process (one float per channel, initialized to zero)
