 * Attempts to get the next block off the DVD and copies it into the buffer &apos;buf&apos;.
 * If there is any special actions that may need to be performed, the value
 * pointed to by &apos;event&apos; gets set accordingly.
 *
 * If &apos;event&apos; is DVDNAV_BLOCK_OK then &apos;buf&apos; is filled with the next block
 * (note that means it has to be at /least/ 2048 bytes big). &apos;len&apos; is
 * then set to 2048.
 *
 * Otherwise, buf is filled with an appropriate event structure and
 * len is set to the length of that structure.
 *
 * See the dvdnav_events.h header for information on the various events.
