     * This is used to track when the pool is to be freed.
     * The pointer to the pool itself held by the caller is considered to
     * be one reference. Each buffer requested by the caller increases refcount
     * by one, returning the buffer to the pool decreases it by one.
     * refcount reaches zero when the buffer has been uninited AND all the
     * buffers have been released, then it&apos;s safe to free the pool and all
     * the buffers in it.
