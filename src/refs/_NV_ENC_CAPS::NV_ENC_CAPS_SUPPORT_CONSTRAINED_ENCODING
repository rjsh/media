     * Indicates Constrained Encoding mode support.
     * Support added from NvEncodeAPI version 2.0.
     * \n 0 : Constrained encoding mode not supported.
     * \n 1 : Constarined encoding mode supported.
     * If this mode is supported client can enable this during initialisation.
     * Client can then force a picture to be coded as constrained picture where
     * each slice in a constrained picture will have constrained_intra_pred_flag set to 1
     * and disable_deblocking_filter_idc will be set to 2 and prediction vectors for inter
     * macroblocks in each slice will be restricted to the slice region.
