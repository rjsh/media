<doc f='include/samba-4.0/libsmbclient.h' l='652'>/**
 * Get whether to url-encode readdir entries.
 *
 * There is a difference in the desired return strings from
 * smbc_readdir() depending upon whether the filenames are to
 * be displayed to the user, or whether they are to be
 * appended to the path name passed to smbc_opendir() to call
 * a further smbc_ function (e.g. open the file with
 * smbc_open()).  In the former case, the filename should be
 * in &quot;human readable&quot; form.  In the latter case, the smbc_
 * functions expect a URL which must be url-encoded.  Those
 * functions decode the URL.  If, for example, smbc_readdir()
 * returned a file name of &quot;abc%20def.txt&quot;, passing a path
 * with this file name attached to smbc_open() would cause
 * smbc_open to attempt to open the file &quot;abc def.txt&quot; since
 * the %20 is decoded into a space.
 *
 * Set this option to True if the names returned by
 * smbc_readdir() should be url-encoded such that they can be
 * passed back to another smbc_ call.  Set it to False if the
 * names returned by smbc_readdir() are to be presented to the
 * user.
 *
 * For backwards compatibility, this option defaults to False.
