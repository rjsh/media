     * will initialize this to the maximum value supported by server,
     * which is recommended.
     *
     * In strict low-latency playback scenarios you might want to set this to
     * a lower value, likely together with the PA_STREAM_ADJUST_LATENCY flag.
     * If you do so, you ensure that the latency doesn&apos;t grow beyond what is
     * acceptable for the use case, at the cost of getting more underruns if
     * the latency is lower than what the server can reliably handle. */</doc>
