 *
 *  This flavor of initialization sets up the encoder to encode to a
 *  native FLAC stream. I/O is performed via callbacks to the client.
 *  For encoding to a plain file via filename or open \c FILE*,
 *  FLAC__stream_encoder_init_file() and FLAC__stream_encoder_init_FILE()
 *  provide a simpler interface.
 *
 *  This function should be called after FLAC__stream_encoder_new() and
 *  FLAC__stream_encoder_set_*() but before FLAC__stream_encoder_process()
 *  or FLAC__stream_encoder_process_interleaved().
 *  initialization succeeded.
 *
 *  The call to FLAC__stream_encoder_init_stream() currently will also
 *  immediately call the write callback several times, once with the \c fLaC
 *  signature, and once for each encoded metadata block.
 *
 * \param  encoder            An uninitialized encoder instance.
 * \param  write_callback     See FLAC__StreamEncoderWriteCallback.  This
 *                            pointer must not be \c NULL.
 * \param  seek_callback      See FLAC__StreamEncoderSeekCallback.  This
 *                            pointer may be \c NULL if seeking is not
 *                            supported.  The encoder uses seeking to go back
 *                            and write some some stream statistics to the
 *                            STREAMINFO block; this is recommended but not
 *                            necessary to create a valid FLAC stream.  If
 *                            \a seek_callback is not \c NULL then a
 *                            \a tell_callback must also be supplied.
 *                            Alternatively, a dummy seek callback that just
 *                            returns \c FLAC__STREAM_ENCODER_SEEK_STATUS_UNSUPPORTED
 *                            may also be supplied, all though this is slightly
 *                            less efficient for the encoder.
 * \param  tell_callback      See FLAC__StreamEncoderTellCallback.  This
 *                            pointer may be \c NULL if seeking is not
 *                            supported.  If \a seek_callback is \c NULL then
 *                            this argument will be ignored.  If
 *                            \a seek_callback is not \c NULL then a
 *                            \a tell_callback must also be supplied.
 *                            Alternatively, a dummy tell callback that just
 *                            returns \c FLAC__STREAM_ENCODER_TELL_STATUS_UNSUPPORTED
 *                            may also be supplied, all though this is slightly
 *                            less efficient for the encoder.
 * \param  metadata_callback  See FLAC__StreamEncoderMetadataCallback.  This
 *                            pointer may be \c NULL if the callback is not
 *                            desired.  If the client provides a seek callback,
 *                            this function is not necessary as the encoder
 *                            will automatically seek back and update the
 *                            STREAMINFO block.  It may also be \c NULL if the
 *                            client does not support seeking, since it will
 *                            have no way of going back to update the
 *                            STREAMINFO.  However the client can still supply
 *                            a callback if it would like to know the details
 *                            from the STREAMINFO.
 * \param  client_data        This value will be supplied to callbacks in their
 *                            \a client_data argument.
 * \assert
 *    \code encoder != NULL \endcode
 * \retval FLAC__StreamEncoderInitStatus
 *    \c FLAC__STREAM_ENCODER_INIT_STATUS_OK if initialization was successful;
 *    see FLAC__StreamEncoderInitStatus for the meanings of other return values.
