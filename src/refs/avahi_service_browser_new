 * interface, resp. protocol to browse on all local networks. The
 * specified callback will be called whenever a new service appears
 * or is removed from the network. Please note that events may be
 * collapsed to minimize traffic (i.e. a REMOVED followed by a NEW for
 * the same service data is dropped because redundant). If you want to
 * subscribe to service data changes, you should use
 * avahi_service_resolver_new() and keep it open, in which case you
 * will be notified via AVAHI_RESOLVE_FOUND everytime the service data
 * changes. */</doc>
