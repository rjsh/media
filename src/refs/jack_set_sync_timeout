<doc f='include/jack/transport.h' l='282'>/**
 * Set the timeout value for @ref slowsyncclients &quot;slow-sync clients&quot;.
 *
 * This timeout prevents unresponsive slow-sync clients from
 * completely halting the transport mechanism.  The default is two
 * seconds.  When the timeout expires, the transport starts rolling,
 * even if some slow-sync clients are still unready.  The @a
 * sync_callbacks of these clients continue being invoked, giving them
 * a chance to catch up.
 *
 * @see jack_set_sync_callback
 *
 * @param client the JACK client structure.
 * @param timeout is delay (in microseconds) before the timeout expires.
 *
 * @return 0 on success, otherwise a non-zero error code.
