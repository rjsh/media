 * \brief Explicitly configure the decoder by passing a raw AudioSpecificConfig (ASC) or a StreamMuxConfig (SMC),
 *  contained in a binary buffer. This is required for MPEG-4 and Raw Packets file format bitstreams
 *  as well as for LATM bitstreams with no in-band SMC. If the transport format is LATM with or without
 *  LOAS, configuration is assumed to be an SMC, for all other file formats an ASC.
 *
 * \param self    AAC decoder handle.
 * \param conf    Pointer to an unsigned char buffer containing the binary configuration buffer (either ASC or SMC).
 * \param length  Length of the configuration buffer in bytes.
 * \return        Error code.
