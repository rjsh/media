     * This callback may be set by the caller immediately after allocating the
     * graph and before adding any filters to it, to provide a custom
     * multithreading implementation.
     *
     * If set, filters with slice threading capability will call this callback
     * to execute multiple jobs in parallel.
     *
     * If this field is left unset, libavfilter will use its internal
     * implementation, which may or may not be multithreaded depending on the
     * platform and build options.
