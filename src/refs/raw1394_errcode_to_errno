 * raw1394_errcode_to_errno - convert libraw1394 errcode to errno
 * @errcode: the error code to convert
 *
 * The error code as retrieved by raw1394_get_errcode() is converted into a
 * roughly equivalent errno number and returned.  %0xdead is returned for an
 * illegal errcode.
 *
 * It is intended to be used to decide what to do (retry, give up, report error)
 * for those programs that aren&apos;t interested in details, since these get lost in
 * the conversion.  However the returned errnos are equivalent in source code
 * meaning only, the associated text of e.g. perror() is not necessarily
 * meaningful.
 *
 * Returns: %EAGAIN (retrying might succeed, also generation number
 * mismatch), %EREMOTEIO (other node had internal problems), %EPERM (operation
 * not allowed on this address, e.g. write on read-only location), %EINVAL
 * (invalid argument) and %EFAULT (invalid pointer).
