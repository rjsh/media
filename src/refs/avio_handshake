 * Perform one step of the protocol handshake to accept a new client.
 * This function must be called on a client returned by avio_accept() before
 * using it as a read/write context.
 * It is separate from avio_accept() because it may block.
 * A step of the handshake is defined by places where the application may
 * decide to change the proceedings.
 * For example, on a protocol with a request header and a reply header, each
 * one can constitute a step because the application may use the parameters
 * from the request to change parameters in the reply; or each individual
 * chunk of the request can constitute a step.
 * If the handshake is already finished, avio_handshake() does nothing and
 * returns 0 immediately.
 *
 * @param  c the client context to perform the handshake on
 * @return   0   on a complete and successful handshake
 *           &gt; 0 if the handshake progressed, but is not complete
 *           &lt; 0 for an AVERROR code
