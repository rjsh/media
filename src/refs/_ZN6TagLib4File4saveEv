     * Save the file and its associated tags.  This should be reimplemented in

     * \warning On UNIX multiple processes are able to write to the same file at
     * the same time.  This can result in serious file corruption.  If you are
     * developing a program that makes use of TagLib from multiple processes you
     * must insure that you are only doing writes to a particular file from one
     * of them.
