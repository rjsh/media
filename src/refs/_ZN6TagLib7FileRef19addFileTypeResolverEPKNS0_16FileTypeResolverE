     * Adds a FileTypeResolver to the list of those used by TagLib.  Each
     * additional FileTypeResolver is added to the front of a list of resolvers
     * that are tried.  If the FileTypeResolver returns zero the next resolver
     * is tried.
     *
     * Returns a pointer to the added resolver (the same one that&apos;s passed in --
     * this is mostly so that static inialializers have something to use for
     * assignment).
