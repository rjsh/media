 * \brief Unregisters a root device registered with \b UpnpRegisterRootDevice,
 * \b UpnpRegisterRootDevice2, \b UpnpRegisterRootDevice3 or
 * \b UpnpRegisterRootDevice4.
 *
 * After this call, the \b UpnpDevice_Handle is no longer valid. For all
 * advertisements that have not yet expired, the SDK sends a device unavailable
 * message automatically.
 *
 * This is a synchronous call and generates no callbacks. Once this call
 * returns, the SDK will no longer generate callbacks to the application.
 *
 * \return An integer representing one of the following:
 *     \li \c UPNP_E_SUCCESS: The operation completed successfully.
 *     \li \c UPNP_E_INVALID_HANDLE: The handle is not a valid device handle.
