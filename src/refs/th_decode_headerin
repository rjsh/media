<doc f='include/theora/theoradec.h' l='189'>/**Decodes the header packets of a Theora stream.
 * This should be called on the initial packets of the stream, in succession,
 *  until it returns &lt;tt&gt;0&lt;/tt&gt;, indicating that all headers have been
 *  processed, or an error is encountered.
 * At least three header packets are required, and additional optional header
 *  packets may follow.
 * This can be used on the first packet of any logical stream to determine if
 *  that stream is a Theora stream.
 * \param _info  A #th_info structure to fill in.
 *               This must have been previously initialized with
 *                th_info_init().
 *               The application may immediately begin using the contents of
 *                this structure after the first header is decoded, though it
 *                must continue to be passed in on all subsequent calls.
 * \param _tc    A #th_comment structure to fill in.
 *               The application may immediately begin using the contents of
 *                this structure after the second header is decoded, though it
 *                must continue to be passed in on all subsequent calls.
 * \param _setup Returns a pointer to additional, private setup information
 *                needed by the decoder.
 *               The contents of this pointer must be initialized to
 *                &lt;tt&gt;NULL&lt;/tt&gt; on the first call, and the returned value must
 *                continue to be passed in on all subsequent calls.
 * \param _op    An &lt;tt&gt;ogg_packet&lt;/tt&gt; structure which contains one of the
 *                initial packets of an Ogg logical stream.
 * \return A positive value indicates that a Theora header was successfully
 *          processed.
 * \retval 0             The first video data packet was encountered after all
 *                        required header packets were parsed.
 *                       The packet just passed in on this call should be saved
 *                        and fed to th_decode_packetin() to begin decoding
 *                        video data.
 * \retval TH_EFAULT     One of \a _info, \a _tc, or \a _setup was
 *                        &lt;tt&gt;NULL&lt;/tt&gt;.
 * \retval TH_EBADHEADER \a _op was &lt;tt&gt;NULL&lt;/tt&gt;, the packet was not the next
 *                        header packet in the expected sequence, or the format
 *                        of the header data was invalid.
 * \retval TH_EVERSION   The packet data was a Theora info header, but for a
 *                        bitstream version not decodable with this version of
 *                        &lt;tt&gt;libtheoradec&lt;/tt&gt;.
 * \retval TH_ENOTFORMAT The packet was not a Theora header.
