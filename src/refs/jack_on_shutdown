 * @param client pointer to JACK client structure.
 * @param function The jack_shutdown function pointer.
 * @param arg The arguments for the jack_shutdown function.
 *
 * Register a function (and argument) to be called if and when the
 * JACK server shuts down the client thread.  The function must
 * be written as if it were an asynchonrous POSIX signal
 * handler --- use only async-safe functions, and remember that it
 * is executed from another thread.  A typical function might
 * set a flag or write to a pipe so that the rest of the
 * application knows that the JACK client thread has shut
 * down.
 *
 * NOTE: clients do not need to call this.  It exists only
 * to help more complex clients understand what is going
 * on.  It should be called before jack_client_activate().
 * 
 * NOTE: if a client calls this AND jack_on_info_shutdown(), then
 * the event of a client thread shutdown, the callback 
 * passed to this function will not be called, and the one passed to
 * jack_on_info_shutdown() will.
