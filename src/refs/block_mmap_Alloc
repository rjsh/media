 * Creates a block from a virtual address memory mapping (mmap).
 * This is provided by LibVLC so that mmap blocks can safely be deallocated
 * even after the allocating plugin has been unloaded from memory.
 *
 * @param addr base address of the mapping (as returned by mmap)
 * @param length length (bytes) of the mapping (as passed to mmap)
 * @return NULL if addr is MAP_FAILED, or an error occurred (in the later
 * case, munmap(addr, length) is invoked before returning).
