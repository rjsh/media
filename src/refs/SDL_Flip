<doc f='include/SDL/SDL_video.h' l='404'>/**
 * On hardware that supports double-buffering, this function sets up a flip
 * and returns.  The hardware will wait for vertical retrace, and then swap
 * video buffers before the next video surface blit or lock will return.
 * On hardware that doesn not support double-buffering, this is equivalent
 * to calling SDL_UpdateRect(screen, 0, 0, 0, 0);
 * The SDL_DOUBLEBUF flag must have been passed to SDL_SetVideoMode() when
 * setting the video mode for this function to perform hardware flipping.
 * This function returns 0 if successful, or -1 if there was an error.
