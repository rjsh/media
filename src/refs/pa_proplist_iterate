 * state variable of type void* and initialize it with NULL. A pointer
 * to this variable should then be passed to pa_proplist_iterate()
 * which should be called in a loop until it returns NULL which
 * signifies EOL. The property list should not be modified during
 * iteration through the list -- with the exception of deleting the
 * current entry. On each invocation this function will return the
 * key string for the next entry. The keys in the property list do not
