 * \brief        Read variable of size &quot;size&quot; as little endian. Convert automatically to host endianess.
 *                4-byte alignment is enforced for 24 bit data, at 32 bit full scale.
 * \param dst    Pointer to memory where to store data into.
 * \param size   Size of each item to be read.
 * \param nmemb  Number of items to be read.
 * \param fp     File pointer of type FDKFILE.
 * \return       Number of items read on success and fread() error on failure.
