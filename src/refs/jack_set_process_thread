 * Tell the Jack server to call @a thread_callback in the RT thread.
 * Typical use are in conjunction with @a jack_cycle_wait and @ jack_cycle_signal functions.
 * The code in the supplied function must be suitable for real-time
 * execution. That means that it cannot call functions that might
 * block for a long time. This includes all I/O functions (disk, TTY, network),
 * malloc, free, printf, pthread_mutex_lock, sleep, wait, poll, select, pthread_join,
 * pthread_cond_wait, etc, etc. 
 *
 * @return 0 on success, otherwise a non-zero error code.
