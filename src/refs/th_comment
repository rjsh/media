<doc f='include/theora/codec.h' l='299'>/**The comment information.
 *
 * This structure holds the in-stream metadata corresponding to
 *  the &apos;comment&apos; header packet.
 * The comment header is meant to be used much like someone jotting a quick
 *  note on the label of a video.
 * It should be a short, to the point text note that can be more than a couple
 *  words, but not more than a short paragraph.
 *
 * The metadata is stored as a series of (tag, value) pairs, in
 *  length-encoded string vectors.
 * The first occurrence of the &apos;=&apos; character delimits the tag and value.
 * A particular tag may occur more than once, and order is significant.
 * The character set encoding for the strings is always UTF-8, but the tag
 *  names are limited to ASCII, and treated as case-insensitive.
 * See &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theora.org/doc/Theora.pdf&quot;&gt;the Theora
 *  specification&lt;/a&gt;, Section 6.3.3 for details.
 *
 * In filling in this structure, th_decode_headerin() will null-terminate
 *  the user_comment strings for safety.
 * However, the bitstream format itself treats them as 8-bit clean vectors,
 *  possibly containing null characters, and so the length array should be
 *  treated as their authoritative length.
