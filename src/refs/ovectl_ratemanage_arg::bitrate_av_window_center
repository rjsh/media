<doc f='include/vorbis/vorbisenc.h' l='253'>/** Regulates the relative centering of the average and hard windows; in
    libvorbis 1.0 and 1.0.1, the hard window regulation overlapped but
    followed the average window regulation. In libvorbis 1.1 a bit-reservoir
    interface replaces the old windowing interface; the older windowing
    interface is simulated and this field has no effect.*/</doc>
