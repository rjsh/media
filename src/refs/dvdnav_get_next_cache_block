 * This basically does the same as dvdnav_get_next_block. The only difference is
 * that it avoids a memcopy, when the requested block was found in the cache.
 * In such a case (cache hit) this function will return a different pointer than
 * the one handed in, pointing directly into the relevant block in the cache.
 * Those pointers must _never_ be freed but instead returned to the library via
 * dvdnav_free_cache_block().
