 * DVDNAV_NAV_PACKET
 *
 * NAV packets are useful for various purposes. They define the button
 * highlight areas and VM commands of DVD menus, so they should in any
 * case be sent to the SPU decoder/overlaying engine for the menus to work.
 * NAV packets also provide a way to detect PTS discontinuities, because
 * they carry the start and end PTS values for the current VOBU.
 * (pci.vobu_s_ptm and pci.vobu_e_ptm) Whenever the start PTS of the
 * current NAV does not match the end PTS of the previous NAV, a PTS
 * discontinuity has occured.
 * NAV packets can also be used for time display, because they are
 * timestamped relatively to the current Cell.
