    Later in this section there are a number of defines that control the
    operation of the code.  In each section, the purpose of each define is
    explained so that the relevant form can be included or excluded by
    setting either 1&apos;s or 0&apos;s respectively on the branches of the related
    #if clauses.  The following local defines should not be changed.
