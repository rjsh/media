 * DVDNAV_HIGHLIGHT
 *
 * The current button highlight changed. Inform the overlaying engine to
 * highlight a different button. Please note, that at the moment only mode 1
 * highlights are reported this way. That means, when the button highlight
 * has been moved around by some function call, you will receive an event
 * telling you the new button. But when a button gets activated, you have
 * to handle the mode 2 highlighting (that is some different colour the
 * button turns to on activation) in your application.
