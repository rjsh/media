 * Hextile Encoding.  The rectangle is divided up into &quot;tiles&quot; of 16x16 pixels,
 * starting at the top left going in left-to-right, top-to-bottom order.  If
 * the width of the rectangle is not an exact multiple of 16 then the width of
 * the last tile in each row will be correspondingly smaller.  Similarly if the
 * height is not an exact multiple of 16 then the height of each tile in the
 * final row will also be smaller.  Each tile begins with a &quot;subencoding&quot; type
 * byte, which is a mask made up of a number of bits.  If the Raw bit is set
 * then the other bits are irrelevant; w*h pixel values follow (where w and h
 * are the width and height of the tile).  Otherwise the tile is encoded in a
 * similar way to RRE, except that the position and size of each subrectangle
 * can be specified in just two bytes.  The other bits in the mask are as
 * follows:
 *
 * BackgroundSpecified - if set, a pixel value follows which specifies
 *    the background colour for this tile.  The first non-raw tile in a
 *    rectangle must have this bit set.  If this bit isn&apos;t set then the
 *    background is the same as the last tile.
 *
 * ForegroundSpecified - if set, a pixel value follows which specifies
 *    the foreground colour to be used for all subrectangles in this tile.
 *    If this bit is set then the SubrectsColoured bit must be zero.
 *
 * AnySubrects - if set, a single byte follows giving the number of
 *    subrectangles following.  If not set, there are no subrectangles (i.e.
 *    the whole tile is just solid background colour).
 *
 * SubrectsColoured - if set then each subrectangle is preceded by a pixel
 *    value giving the colour of that subrectangle.  If not set, all
 *    subrectangles are the same colour, the foreground colour;  if the
 *    ForegroundSpecified bit wasn&apos;t set then the foreground is the same as
 *    the last tile.
 *
 * The position and size of each subrectangle is specified in two bytes.  The
 * Pack macros below can be used to generate the two bytes from x, y, w, h,
 * and the Extract macros can be used to extract the x, y, w, h values from
 * the two bytes.
