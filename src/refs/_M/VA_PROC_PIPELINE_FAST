 * \brief Specifies whether to apply power or performance
 * optimizations to a pipeline.
 *
 * When processing several surfaces, it may be necessary to prioritize
 * more certain pipelines than others. This flag is only a hint to the
 * video processor so that it can omit certain filters to save power
 * for example. Typically, this flag could be used with video surfaces
 * decoded from a secondary bitstream.
