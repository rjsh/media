 * \brief 8-bit per component packed into 32-bits
 *
 * This format is an array of packed 32-bit RGB color values.
 * Bits [31:24] are unused, bits [23:16] contain R, bits [15:8]
 * contain G, and bits [7:0] contain B. Note: The format is
 * physically an array of uint32_t values, and should be accessed
 * as such by the application in order to avoid endianness
 * issues.
