 * rfbConnFailed:	For some reason the connection failed (e.g. the server
 *			cannot support the desired protocol version).  This is
 *			followed by a string describing the reason (where a
 *			string is specified as a 32-bit length followed by that
 *			many ASCII characters).
 *
 * rfbNoAuth:		No authentication is needed.
 *
 * rfbVncAuth:		The VNC authentication scheme is to be used.  A 16-byte
 *			challenge follows, which the client encrypts as
 *			appropriate using the password and sends the resulting
 *			16-byte response.  If the response is correct, the
 *			server sends the 32-bit word rfbVncAuthOK.  If a simple
 *			failure happens, the server sends rfbVncAuthFailed and
 *			closes the connection. If the server decides that too
 *			many failures have occurred, it sends rfbVncAuthTooMany
 *			and closes the connection.  In the latter case, the
 *			server should not allow an immediate reconnection by
 *			the client.
