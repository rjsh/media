   *
   *  Each encoder advertises the capabilities it supports as part of its
   *  ::vpx_codec_iface_t interface structure. Capabilities are extra
   *  interfaces or functionality, and are not required to be supported
   *  by an encoder.
   *
   *  The available flags are specified by VPX_CODEC_CAP_* defines.
