<doc f='include/theora/theoraenc.h' l='196'>/**Sets the size of the bitrate management bit reservoir as a function
 *  of number of frames.
 * The reservoir size affects how quickly bitrate management reacts to
 *  instantaneous changes in the video complexity.
 * Larger reservoirs react more slowly, and provide better overall quality, but
 *  require more buffering by a client, adding more latency to live streams.
 * By default, libtheora sets the reservoir to the maximum distance between
 *  keyframes, subject to a minimum and maximum limit.
 * This call may be used to increase or decrease the reservoir, increasing or
 *  decreasing the allowed temporary variance in bitrate.
 * An implementation may impose some limits on the size of a reservoir it can
 *  handle, in which case the actual reservoir size may not be exactly what was
 *  requested.
 * The actual value set will be returned.
 *
 * \param[in]  _buf &lt;tt&gt;int&lt;/tt&gt;: Requested size of the reservoir measured in
 *                   frames.
 * \param[out] _buf &lt;tt&gt;int&lt;/tt&gt;: The actual size of the reservoir set.
 * \retval TH_EFAULT \a _enc_ctx or \a _buf is &lt;tt&gt;NULL&lt;/tt&gt;.
 * \retval TH_EINVAL \a _buf_sz is not &lt;tt&gt;sizeof(int)&lt;/tt&gt;, or rate control
 *                    is not enabled.  The buffer has an implementation
 *                    defined minimum and maximum size and the value in _buf
 *                    will be adjusted to match the actual value set.
 * \retval TH_EIMPL   Not supported by this implementation in the current
 *                    encoding mode.*/</doc>
