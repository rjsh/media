 * \brief The VDPAU interface version described by this header file.
 *
 * This version will only increase if a major incompatible change is made.
 * For example, if the parameters passed to an existing function are modified,
 * rather than simply adding new functions/enumerations), or if the mechanism
 * used to load the backend driver is modified incompatibly. Such changes are
 * unlikely.
 *
 * This value also represents the DSO version of VDPAU-related
 * shared-libraries.
 *
 * VDPAU version numbers are simple integers that increase monotonically
 * (typically by value 1).
