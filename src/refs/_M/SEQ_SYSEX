 * SEQ_SYSEX permits sending of sysex messages. (It may look that it permits
 * sending any MIDI bytes but it&apos;s absolutely not possible. Trying to do
 * so _will_ cause problems with MPU401 intelligent mode).
 *
 * Sysex messages are sent in blocks of 1 to 6 bytes. Longer messages must be 
 * sent by calling SEQ_SYSEX() several times (there must be no other events
 * between them). First sysex fragment must have 0xf0 in the first byte
 * and the last byte (buf[len-1] of the last fragment must be 0xf7. No byte
 * between these sysex start and end markers cannot be larger than 0x7f. Also
 * lengths of each fragments (except the last one) must be 6.
 *
 * Breaking the above rules may work with some MIDI ports but is likely to
 * cause fatal problems with some other devices (such as MPU401).
