 * Although libtheora can encode duplicate frames very cheaply, it costs some
 *  amount of CPU to detect them, and a run of duplicates cannot span a
 *  keyframe boundary.
 * This control code tells the encoder to produce the specified number of extra
 *  duplicates of the next frame.
 * This allows the encoder to make smarter keyframe placement decisions and
 *  rate control decisions, and reduces CPU usage as well, when compared to
 *  just submitting the same frame for encoding multiple times.
 * This setting only applies to the next frame submitted for encoding.
 * You MUST call th_encode_packetout() repeatedly until it returns 0, or the
 *  extra duplicate frames will be lost.
 *
 * \param[in] _buf &lt;tt&gt;int&lt;/tt&gt;: The number of duplicates to produce.
 *                 If this is negative or zero, no duplicates will be produced.
 * \retval TH_EFAULT \a _enc_ctx or \a _buf is &lt;tt&gt;NULL&lt;/tt&gt;.
 * \retval TH_EINVAL \a _buf_sz is not &lt;tt&gt;sizeof(int)&lt;/tt&gt;, or the
 *                    number of duplicates is greater than or equal to the
 *                    maximum keyframe interval.
 *                   In the latter case, NO duplicate frames will be produced.
 *                   You must ensure that the maximum keyframe interval is set
 *                    larger than the maximum number of duplicates you will
 *                    ever wish to insert prior to encoding.
 * \retval TH_EIMPL   Not supported by this implementation in the current
 *                    encoding mode.*/</doc>
