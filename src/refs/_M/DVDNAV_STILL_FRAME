 * DVDNAV_STILL_FRAME
 *
 * We have reached a still frame. The player application should wait
 * the amount of time specified by the still&apos;s length while still handling
 * user input to make menus and other interactive stills work.
 * The last delivered frame should be kept showing.
 * Once the still has timed out, call dvdnav_skip_still().
 * A length of 0xff means an infinite still which has to be skipped
 * indirectly by some user interaction.
