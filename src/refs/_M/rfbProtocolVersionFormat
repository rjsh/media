 * Protocol Version
 *
 * The server always sends 12 bytes to start which identifies the latest RFB
 * protocol version number which it supports.  These bytes are interpreted
 * as a string of 12 ASCII characters in the format &quot;RFB xxx.yyy\n&quot; where
 * xxx and yyy are the major and minor version numbers (for version 3.3
 * this is &quot;RFB 003.003\n&quot;).
 *
 * The client then replies with a similar 12-byte message giving the version
 * number of the protocol which should actually be used (which may be different
 * to that quoted by the server).
 *
 * It is intended that both clients and servers may provide some level of
 * backwards compatibility by this mechanism.  Servers in particular should
 * attempt to provide backwards compatibility, and even forwards compatibility
 * to some extent.  For example if a client demands version 3.1 of the
 * protocol, a 3.0 server can probably assume that by ignoring requests for
 * encoding types it doesn&apos;t understand, everything will still work OK.  This
 * will probably not be the case for changes in the major version number.
 *
 * The format string below can be used in sprintf or sscanf to generate or
 * decode the version string respectively.
