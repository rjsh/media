 * \brief The SDK had a problem binding a socket to a network interface.
 *
 * This occurs in any function that makes network connections, such as discovery
 * (e.g. \b UpnpSearchAsync or \b UpnpSendAdvertisement), control (e.g.
 * \b UpnpSendAction), eventing (e.g. \b UpnpNotify), and HTTP functions (e.g. 
 * \b UpnpDownloadXmlDoc).
