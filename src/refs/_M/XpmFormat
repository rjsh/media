 * first some identification numbers:
 * the version and revision numbers are determined with the following rule:
 * SO Major number = LIB minor version number.
 * SO Minor number = LIB sub-minor version number.
 * e.g: Xpm version 3.2f
 *      we forget the 3 which is the format number, 2 gives 2, and f gives 6.
 *      thus we have XpmVersion = 2 and XpmRevision = 6
 *      which gives  SOXPMLIBREV = 2.6
 *
 * Then the XpmIncludeVersion number is built from these numbers.
