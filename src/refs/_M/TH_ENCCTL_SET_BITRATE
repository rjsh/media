<doc f='include/theora/theoraenc.h' l='314'>/**Sets the current encoding bitrate.
 * Once a bitrate is set, the encoder must use a rate-controlled mode for all
 *  future frames (this restriction may be relaxed in a future version).
 * If it is set before the headers are emitted, the target bitrate encoded in
 *  them will be updated.
 * Due to the buffer delay, the exact bitrate of each section of the encode is
 *  not guaranteed.
 * The encoder may have already used more bits than allowed for the frames it
 *  has encoded, expecting to make them up in future frames, or it may have
 *  used fewer, holding the excess in reserve.
 * The exact transition between the two bitrates is not well-defined by this
 *  API, but may be affected by flags set with #TH_ENCCTL_SET_RATE_FLAGS.
 * After a number of frames equal to the buffer delay, one may expect further
 *  output to average at the target bitrate.

 * \retval TH_EIMPL       Not supported by this implementation.*/</doc>
