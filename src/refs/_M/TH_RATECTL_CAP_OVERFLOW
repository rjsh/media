 * If the encoder uses so few bits that the reservoir of available bits
 *  overflows, ignore the excess.
 * The encoder will not try to use these extra bits in future frames.
 * At high rates this may cause the result to be undersized, but allows a
 *  client to play the stream using a finite buffer; it should normally be
