<doc f='include/pulse/proplist.h' l='71'>/** For streams: the name of a filter that is desired, e.g.\ &quot;echo-cancel&quot; or &quot;equalizer-sink&quot;. Differs from PA_PROP_FILTER_WANT in that it forces PulseAudio to apply the filter, regardless of whether PulseAudio thinks it makes sense to do so or not. If this is set, PA_PROP_FILTER_WANT is ignored. In other words, you almost certainly do not want to use this. \since 1.0 */</doc>
