 * DVDNAV_WAIT
 *
 * We have reached a point in DVD playback, where timing is critical.
 * Player application with internal fifos can introduce state
 * inconsistencies, because libdvdnav is always the fifo&apos;s length
 * ahead in the stream compared to what the application sees.
 * Such applications should wait until their fifos are empty
 * when they receive this type of event.
 * Once this is achieved, call dvdnav_skip_wait().
