 * The H_ prefix indicates header file version, the C_* prefix indicates the corresponding
 * object version.
 *
 * Declaring memory areas requires to specify a unique name and a data type. Use the H_ macro
 * for this purpose inside a header file.
 *
 * For defining a memory area your require additionally one or two sizes, depending if the
 * memory should be organized into one or two dimensions.
 *
 * The macros containing the keyword AALLOC instead of ALLOC also do take care of returning
 * aligned memory addresses (beyond the natural alignment of its type). The preprocesor macro
 * ::ALIGNMENT_DEFAULT indicates the aligment to be used (this is hardware specific).
 *
 * The _L suffix indicates that the memory will be located in a specific section. This is
 * useful to allocate critical memory section into fast internal SRAM for example.
