<doc f='MediaInfoLib/ThirdParty/aes-gladman/brg_types.h' l='166'>/*  These defines are used to declare buffers in a way that allows
    faster operations on longer variables to be used.  In all these
    defines &apos;size&apos; must be a power of 2 and &gt;= 8. NOTE that the 
    buffer size is in bytes but the type length is in bits

    UNIT_TYPEDEF(x,size)        declares a variable &apos;x&apos; of length 
                                &apos;size&apos; bits

    BUFR_TYPEDEF(x,size,bsize)  declares a buffer &apos;x&apos; of length &apos;bsize&apos; 
                                bytes defined as an array of variables
                                each of &apos;size&apos; bits (bsize must be a 
                                multiple of size / 8)

    UNIT_CAST(x,size)           casts a variable to a type of 
                                length &apos;size&apos; bits

    UPTR_CAST(x,size)           casts a pointer to a pointer to a 
                                varaiable of length &apos;size&apos; bits
