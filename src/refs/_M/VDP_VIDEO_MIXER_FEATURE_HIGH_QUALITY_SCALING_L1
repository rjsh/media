 * \brief A VdpVideoMixerFeature.
 *
 * A VDPAU implementation may support multiple scaling algorithms of
 * differing quality, and may potentially support a different subset
 * of algorithms on different hardware.
 *
 * In some cases, higher quality algorithms may require more resources
 * (memory size, memory bandwidth, etc.) to operate. Hence, these high
 * quality algorithms must be explicitly requested and enabled by the client
 * application. This allows applications operating in a resource-constrained
 * environment to have some level of control over resource usage.
 *
 * Basic scaling is always built into any video mixer, and is known as
 * level 0. Scaling quality increases beginning with optional level 1,
 * through optional level 9.
 *
 * If an application requests and enables multiple high quality scaling
 * algorithms, the highest level enabled scaling algorithm will be used.
