 * \brief The VDPAU version described by this header file.
 *
 * This version will increase whenever any non-documentation change is made to
 * vdpau.h, or related header files such as vdpau_x11.h. Such changes
 * typically involve the addition of new functions, constants, or features.
 * Such changes are expected to be completely backwards-compatible.
 *
 * VDPAU version numbers are simple integers that increase monotonically
 * (typically by value 1).
