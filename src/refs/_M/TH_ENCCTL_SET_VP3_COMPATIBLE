<doc f='include/theora/theoraenc.h' l='80'>/**Disables any encoder features that would prevent lossless transcoding back
 *  to VP3.
 * This primarily means disabling block-adaptive quantization and always coding
 *  all four luma blocks in a macro block when 4MV is used.
 * It also includes using the VP3 quantization tables and Huffman codes; if you
 *  set them explicitly after calling this function, the resulting stream will
 *  not be VP3-compatible.
 * If you enable VP3-compatibility when encoding 4:2:2 or 4:4:4 source
 *  material, or when using a picture region smaller than the full frame (e.g.
 *  a non-multiple-of-16 width or height), then non-VP3 bitstream features will
 *  still be disabled, but the stream will still not be VP3-compatible, as VP3
 *  was not capable of encoding such formats.
 * If you call this after encoding has already begun, then the quantization
 *  tables and codebooks cannot be changed, but the frame-level features will
 *  be enabled or disabled as requested.
 *
 * \param[in]  _buf &lt;tt&gt;int&lt;/tt&gt;: a non-zero value to enable VP3 compatibility,
 *                   or 0 to disable it (the default).
 * \param[out] _buf &lt;tt&gt;int&lt;/tt&gt;: 1 if all bitstream features required for
 *                   VP3-compatibility could be set, and 0 otherwise.
 *                  The latter will be returned if the pixel format is not
 *                   4:2:0, the picture region is smaller than the full frame,
 *                   or if encoding has begun, preventing the quantization
 *                   tables and codebooks from being set.
 * \retval TH_EFAULT \a _enc_ctx or \a _buf is &lt;tt&gt;NULL&lt;/tt&gt;.
 * \retval TH_EINVAL \a _buf_sz is not &lt;tt&gt;sizeof(int)&lt;/tt&gt;.
 * \retval TH_EIMPL   Not supported by this implementation.*/</doc>
