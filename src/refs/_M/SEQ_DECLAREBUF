 *	Some convenience macros to simplify programming of the
 *	/dev/sequencer interface
 *
 *	This is a legacy interface for applications written against
 *	the OSSlib-3.8 style interface. It is no longer possible
 *	to actually link against OSSlib with this header, but we
 *	still provide these macros for programs using them.
 *
 *	If you want to use OSSlib, it is recommended that you get
 *	the GPL version of OSS-4.x and build against that version
 *	of the header.
 *
 *	We redefine the extern keyword so that make headers_check
 *	does not complain about SEQ_USE_EXTBUF.
