 * Pass 1 mode must be enabled before the first frame is encoded, and a target
 *  bitrate must have already been specified to the encoder.
 * Although this does not have to be the exact rate that will be used in the
 *  second pass, closer values may produce better results.
 * The first call returns the size of the two-pass header data, along with some
 *  placeholder content, and sets the encoder into pass 1 mode implicitly.
 * This call sets the encoder to pass 1 mode implicitly.
 * Then, a subsequent call must be made after each call to
 *  th_encode_ycbcr_in() to retrieve the metrics for that frame.
 * An additional, final call must be made to retrieve the summary data,
 *  containing such information as the total number of frames, etc.
 * This must be stored in place of the placeholder data that was returned
 *  in the first call, before the frame metrics data.
 * All of this data must be presented back to the encoder during pass 2 using
 *  #TH_ENCCTL_2PASS_IN.
 *
 * \param[out] &lt;tt&gt;char *&lt;/tt&gt;_buf: Returns a pointer to internal storage
 *              containing the two pass metrics data.
 *             This storage is only valid until the next call, or until the
 *              encoder context is freed, and must be copied by the
 *              application.
 * \retval &gt;=0       The number of bytes of metric data available in the
 *                    returned buffer.
 * \retval TH_EFAULT \a _enc_ctx or \a _buf is &lt;tt&gt;NULL&lt;/tt&gt;.
 * \retval TH_EINVAL \a _buf_sz is not &lt;tt&gt;sizeof(char *)&lt;/tt&gt;, no target
 *                    bitrate has been set, or the first call was made after
 *                    the first frame was submitted for encoding.
 * \retval TH_EIMPL   Not supported by this implementation.*/</doc>
