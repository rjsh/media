 * Hint FLUID_HINT_SAMPLE_RATE indicates that any bounds specified
 * should be interpreted as multiples of the sample rate. For
 * instance, a frequency range from 0Hz to the Nyquist frequency (half
 * the sample rate) could be requested by this hint in conjunction
 * with LowerBound = 0 and UpperBound = 0.5. Hosts that support bounds
 * at all must support this hint to retain meaning.
