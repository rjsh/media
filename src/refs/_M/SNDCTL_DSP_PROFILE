 * Application&apos;s profile defines the way how playback underrun situations should be handled.
 * 
 *	APF_NORMAL (the default) and APF_NETWORK make the driver to cleanup the
 *	playback buffer whenever an underrun occurs. This consumes some time
 *	prevents looping the existing buffer.
 *	APF_CPUINTENS is intended to be set by CPU intensive applications which
 *	are likely to run out of time occasionally. In this mode the buffer cleanup is
 *	disabled which saves CPU time but also let&apos;s the previous buffer content to
 *	be played during the &quot;pause&quot; after the underrun.
