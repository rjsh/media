       * Implements the unified property interface -- export function.
       * This function does some work to translate the hard-specified ID3v2
       * frame types into a free-form string-to-stringlist PropertyMap:
       *  - if ID3v2 frame ID is known by Frame::frameIDToKey(), the returned
       *    key is used
       *  - if the frame ID is &quot;TXXX&quot; (user text frame), the description() is
       *    used as key
       *  - if the frame ID is &quot;WXXX&quot; (user url frame),
       *    - if the description is empty or &quot;URL&quot;, the key &quot;URL&quot; is used
       *    - otherwise, the key &quot;URL:&lt;description&gt;&quot; is used;
       *  - if the frame ID is &quot;COMM&quot; (comments frame),
       *    - if the description is empty or &quot;COMMENT&quot;, the key &quot;COMMENT&quot;
       *      is used
       *    - otherwise, the key &quot;COMMENT:&lt;description&gt;&quot; is used;
       *  - if the frame ID is &quot;USLT&quot; (unsynchronized lyrics),
       *    - if the description is empty or &quot;LYRICS&quot;, the key &quot;LYRICS&quot; is used
       *    - otherwise, the key &quot;LYRICS:&lt;description&gt;&quot; is used;
       *  - if the frame ID is &quot;TIPL&quot; (involved peoples list), and if all the
       *    roles defined in the frame are known in TextIdentificationFrame::involvedPeopleMap(),
       *    then &quot;&lt;role&gt;=&lt;name&gt;&quot; will be contained in the returned obejct for each
       *  - if the frame ID is &quot;TMCL&quot; (musician credit list), then
       *    &quot;PERFORMER:&lt;instrument&gt;=&lt;name&gt;&quot; will be contained in the returned
       *    PropertyMap for each defined musician
       *  In any other case, the unsupportedData() of the returned object will contain
       *  the frame&apos;s ID and, in case of a frame ID which is allowed to appear more than
       *  once, the description, separated by a &quot;/&quot;.
