 * A list of supported channel layouts.
 *
 * The list works the same as AVFilterFormats, except for the following
 * differences:
 * - A list with all_layouts = 1 means all channel layouts with a known
 *   disposition; nb_channel_layouts must then be 0.
 * - A list with all_counts = 1 means all channel counts, with a known or
 *   unknown disposition; nb_channel_layouts must then be 0 and all_layouts 1.
 * - The list must not contain a layout with a known disposition and a
 *   channel count with unknown disposition with the same number of channels
 *   (e.g. AV_CH_LAYOUT_STEREO and FF_COUNT2LAYOUT(2).
