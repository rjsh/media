 * This function opens the audio device with the desired parameters, and
 * returns 0 if successful, placing the actual hardware parameters in the
 * structure pointed to by &apos;obtained&apos;.  If &apos;obtained&apos; is NULL, the audio
 * data passed to the callback function will be guaranteed to be in the
 * requested format, and will be automatically converted to the hardware
 * audio format if necessary.  This function returns -1 if it failed 
 * to open the audio device, or couldn&apos;t set up the audio thread.
 *
 * The audio device starts out playing silence when it&apos;s opened, and should
 * be enabled for playing by calling SDL_PauseAudio(0) when you are ready
 * for your audio callback function to be called.  Since the audio driver
 * may modify the requested size of the audio buffer, you should allocate
 * any local mixing buffers after you open the audio device.
