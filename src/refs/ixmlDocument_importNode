 * \brief Imports a \b Node from another \b Document into this \b Document.
 *
 * The returned new \b Node does not a have parent node (parentNode is null):
 * it is a clone of the original \b Node with the \c ownerDocument set to
 * \b doc. The source node is not altered or removed from the original 
 * document.
 *
 * For all nodes, importing a node creates a node object owned by the
 * importing document, with attribute values identical to the source
 * node&apos;s nodeName and nodeType, plus the attributes related to namespaces
 * (prefix, localName, and namespaceURI).
 *
 * As in the cloneNode operation on a node, the source node is not altered.
 * 
 * The \b deep parameter controls whether all the children of the \b Node are
 * imported.
 *
 * Refer to the DOM2-Core recommendation for details on importing specific
 * node types.
 *
 * \return An integer representing one of the following:
 *     \li \c IXML_SUCCESS: The operation completed successfully.
 *     \li \c IXML_INVALID_PARAMETER: Either \b doc or 
 *           \b importNode is not a valid pointer.
 *     \li \c IXML_NOT_SUPPORTED_ERR: \b importNode is a 
 *           \b Document, which cannot be imported.
 *     \li \c IXML_FAILED: The import operation failed because the 
 *           \b Node to be imported could not be cloned.
