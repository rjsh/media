 * raw1394_get_port_info - get information about available ports
 * @handle: libraw1394 handle
 * @pinf: pointer to an array of struct raw1394_portinfo
 * @maxports: number of elements in @pinf
 *
 * Before you can set which port to use, you have to use this function to find
 * out which ports exist.
 *
 * If your program is interactive, you should present the user with this list to
 * let them decide which port to use if there is more than one.  A
 * non-interactive program (and probably interactive ones, too) should provide a
 * command line option to choose the port. If @maxports is %0, @pinf can be
 * %NULL, too.
 *
 * Returns: the number of ports and writes information about them into @pinf, but
 * not into more than @maxports elements.
