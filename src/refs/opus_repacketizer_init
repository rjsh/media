<doc f='include/opus/opus.h' l='758'>/** (Re)initializes a previously allocated repacketizer state.
  * The state must be at least the size returned by opus_repacketizer_get_size().
  * This can be used for applications which use their own allocator instead of
  * malloc().
  * It must also be called to reset the queue of packets waiting to be
  * repacketized, which is necessary if the maximum packet duration of 120 ms
  * is reached or if you wish to submit packets with a different Opus
  * configuration (coding mode, audio bandwidth, frame size, or channel count).
  * Failure to do so will prevent a new packet from being added with
  * opus_repacketizer_cat().
  * @see opus_repacketizer_create
  * @see opus_repacketizer_get_size
  * @see opus_repacketizer_cat
  * @param rp &lt;tt&gt;OpusRepacketizer*&lt;/tt&gt;: The repacketizer state to
  *                                       (re)initialize.
  * @returns A pointer to the same repacketizer state that was passed in.
