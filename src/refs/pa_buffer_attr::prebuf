<doc f='include/pulse/def.h' l='372'>/**&lt; Playback only: target length of the buffer. The server tries
     * to assure that at least tlength bytes are always available in
     * the per-stream server-side playback buffer. It is recommended
     * to set this to (uint32_t) -1, which will initialize this to a
     * value that is deemed sensible by the server. However, this
     * value will default to something like 2s, i.e. for applications
     * that have specific latency requirements this value should be
     * set to the maximum latency that the application can deal
     * with. When PA_STREAM_ADJUST_LATENCY is not set this value will
     * influence only the per-stream playback buffer size. When
     * PA_STREAM_ADJUST_LATENCY is set the overall latency of the sink
     * plus the playback buffer size is configured to this value. Set
     * PA_STREAM_ADJUST_LATENCY if you are interested in adjusting the
     * overall latency. Don&apos;t set it if you are interested in
     * configuring the server-side per-stream playback buffer
     * size. */</doc>
