<doc f='include/x264.h' l='465'>/* Pulldown:
     * The correct pic_struct must be passed with each input frame.
     * The input timebase should be the timebase corresponding to the output framerate. This should be constant.
     * e.g. for 3:2 pulldown timebase should be 1001/30000
     * The PTS passed with each frame must be the PTS of the frame after pulldown is applied.
     * Frame doubling and tripling require b_vfr_input set to zero (see H.264 Table D-1)
     *
     * Pulldown changes are not clearly defined in H.264. Therefore, it is the calling app&apos;s responsibility to manage this.
