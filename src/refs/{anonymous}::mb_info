<doc f='include/x264.h' l='749'>/* In: optional array of flags for each macroblock.
     *     Allows specifying additional information for the encoder such as which macroblocks
     *     remain unchanged.  Usable flags are listed below.
     *     x264_param_t.analyse.b_mb_info must be set to use this, since x264 needs to track
     *     extra data internally to make full use of this information.
     *
     * Out: if b_mb_info_update is set, x264 will update this array as a result of encoding.
     *
     *      For &quot;MBINFO_CONSTANT&quot;, it will remove this flag on any macroblock whose decoded
     *      pixels have changed.  This can be useful for e.g. noting which areas of the
     *      frame need to actually be blitted. Note: this intentionally ignores the effects
     *      of deblocking for the current frame, which should be fine unless one needs exact
     *      pixel-perfect accuracy.
     *
     *      Results for MBINFO_CONSTANT are currently only set for P-frames, and are not
     *      guaranteed to enumerate all blocks which haven&apos;t changed.  (There may be false
     *      negatives, but no false positives.)
