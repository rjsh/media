<doc f='include/vpx/vp8cx.h' l='292'>/*!\brief Boost percentage for Golden Frame in CBR mode.
   *
   * This value controls the amount of boost given to Golden Frame in
   * CBR mode. It is expressed as a percentage of the average
   * per-frame bitrate, with the special (and default) value 0 meaning
   * the feature is off, i.e., no golden frame boost in CBR mode and
   * average bitrate target is used.
   *
   * For example, to allow 100% more bits, i.e, 2X, in a golden frame
   * than average frame, set this to 100.
   *
   * Supported in codecs: VP9
