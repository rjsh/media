 * raw1394_read - send async read request to a node and wait for response.
 * @handle: libraw1394 handle
 * @node: target node ID
 * @addr: address to read from
 * @length: amount of bytes of data to read
 * @buffer: pointer to buffer where data will be saved
 *
 * If @length is %4, a quadlet read request is used.
 *
 * This does the complete transaction and will return when it&apos;s finished.  It
 * will call raw1394_loop_iterate() as often as necessary, return values of
 * handlers called will be therefore lost.
 *
 * Returns: 0 on success or -1 on failure (sets errno)
