 * Derive an VAImage from an existing surface.
 * This interface will derive a VAImage and corresponding image buffer from
 * an existing VA Surface. The image buffer can then be mapped/unmapped for
 * direct CPU access. This operation is only possible on implementations with
 * direct rendering capabilities and internal surface formats that can be
 * represented with a VAImage. When the operation is not possible this interface
 * will return VA_STATUS_ERROR_OPERATION_FAILED. Clients should then fall back
 * to using vaCreateImage + vaPutImage to accomplish the same task in an
 * indirect manner.
 *
 * Implementations should only return success when the resulting image buffer
 * would be useable with vaMap/Unmap.
 *
 * When directly accessing a surface special care must be taken to insure
 * proper synchronization with the graphics hardware. Clients should call
 * vaQuerySurfaceStatus to insure that a surface is not the target of concurrent
 * rendering or currently being displayed by an overlay.
 *
 * Additionally nothing about the contents of a surface should be assumed
 * following a vaPutSurface. Implementations are free to modify the surface for
 * scaling or subpicture blending within a call to vaPutImage.
 *
 * Calls to vaPutImage or vaGetImage using the same surface from which the image
 * has been derived will return VA_STATUS_ERROR_SURFACE_BUSY. vaPutImage or
 * vaGetImage with other surfaces is supported.
 *
 * An image created with vaDeriveImage should be freed with vaDestroyImage. The
 * image and image buffer structures will be destroyed; however, the underlying
 * surface will remain unchanged until freed with vaDestroySurfaces.
