 * raw1394_update_generation - set generation number of handle
 * @handle: libraw1394 handle
 * @generation: new generation number
 *
 * This function sets the generation number of the handle to @gen.  All requests
 * that apply to a single node ID are tagged with this number and abort with an
 * error if that is different from the generation number kept in the kernel.
 * This avoids acting on the wrong node which may have changed its ID in a bus
 * reset.
 *
 * You should call this within your bus reset handler with an incremented value.
