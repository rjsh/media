 * Specify whether read-ahead caching should be used. You may not want this if your
 * decoding engine does its own buffering.
 *
 * The default read-ahead cache does not use an additional thread for the reading
 * (see read_cache.c for a threaded cache, but note that this code is currently
 * unmaintained). It prebuffers on VOBU level by reading ahead several buffers
 * on every read request. The speed of this prebuffering has been optimized to
 * also work on slow DVD drives.
 *
 * If in addition you want to prevent memcpy&apos;s to improve performance, have a look
 * at dvdnav_get_next_cache_block().
