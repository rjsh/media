 * gnutls_certificate_verify_flags:
 * @GNUTLS_VERIFY_DISABLE_CA_SIGN: If set a signer does not have to be
 *   a certificate authority. This flag should normally be disabled,
 *   unless you know what this means.
 * @GNUTLS_VERIFY_DISABLE_TRUSTED_TIME_CHECKS: If set a signer in the trusted
 *   list is never checked for expiration or activation.
 * @GNUTLS_VERIFY_ALLOW_X509_V1_CA_CRT: Allow trusted CA certificates
 *   with version 1. This is safer than %GNUTLS_VERIFY_ALLOW_ANY_X509_V1_CA_CRT,
 *   and should be used instead. That way only signers in your trusted list
 *   will be allowed to have certificates of version 1. This is the default.
 * @GNUTLS_VERIFY_DO_NOT_ALLOW_X509_V1_CA_CRT: Do not allow trusted CA
 *   certificates that have version 1.  This option is to be used
 *   to deprecate all certificates of version 1.
 * @GNUTLS_VERIFY_DO_NOT_ALLOW_SAME: If a certificate is not signed by
 *   anyone trusted but exists in the trusted CA list do not treat it
 *   as trusted.
 * @GNUTLS_VERIFY_ALLOW_UNSORTED_CHAIN: A certificate chain is tolerated
 *   if unsorted (the case with many TLS servers out there). This is the
 *   default since GnuTLS 3.1.4.
 * @GNUTLS_VERIFY_DO_NOT_ALLOW_UNSORTED_CHAIN: Do not tolerate an unsorted
 *   certificate chain.
 * @GNUTLS_VERIFY_ALLOW_ANY_X509_V1_CA_CRT: Allow CA certificates that
 *   have version 1 (both root and intermediate). This might be
 *   dangerous since those haven&apos;t the basicConstraints
 *   extension. Must be used in combination with
 *   %GNUTLS_VERIFY_ALLOW_X509_V1_CA_CRT.
 * @GNUTLS_VERIFY_ALLOW_SIGN_RSA_MD2: Allow certificates to be signed
 *   using the broken MD2 algorithm.
 * @GNUTLS_VERIFY_ALLOW_SIGN_RSA_MD5: Allow certificates to be signed
 *   using the broken MD5 algorithm.
 * @GNUTLS_VERIFY_DISABLE_TIME_CHECKS: Disable checking of activation
 *   and expiration validity periods of certificate chains. Don&apos;t set
 *   this unless you understand the security implications.
 * @GNUTLS_VERIFY_DISABLE_CRL_CHECKS: Disable checking for validity
 *   using certificate revocation lists or the available OCSP data.
