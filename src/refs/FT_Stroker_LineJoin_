   * @enum:
   *   FT_Stroker_LineJoin
   *
   * @description:
   *   These values determine how two joining lines are rendered
   *   in a stroker.
   *
   * @values:
   *   FT_STROKER_LINEJOIN_ROUND ::
   *     Used to render rounded line joins.  Circular arcs are used
   *     to join two lines smoothly.
   *
   *   FT_STROKER_LINEJOIN_BEVEL ::
   *     Used to render beveled line joins.  The outer corner of
   *     the joined lines is filled by enclosing the triangular
   *     region of the corner with a straight line between the
   *     outer corners of each stroke.
   *
   *   FT_STROKER_LINEJOIN_MITER_FIXED ::
   *     Used to render mitered line joins, with fixed bevels if the
   *     miter limit is exceeded.  The outer edges of the strokes
   *     for the two segments are extended until they meet at an
   *     angle.  If the segments meet at too sharp an angle (such
   *     that the miter would extend from the intersection of the
   *     segments a distance greater than the product of the miter
   *     limit value and the border radius), then a bevel join (see
   *     above) is used instead.  This prevents long spikes being
   *     created.  FT_STROKER_LINEJOIN_MITER_FIXED generates a miter
   *     line join as used in PostScript and PDF.
   *
   *   FT_STROKER_LINEJOIN_MITER_VARIABLE ::
   *   FT_STROKER_LINEJOIN_MITER ::
   *     Used to render mitered line joins, with variable bevels if
   *     the miter limit is exceeded.  The intersection of the
   *     strokes is clipped at a line perpendicular to the bisector
   *     of the angle between the strokes, at the distance from the
   *     intersection of the segments equal to the product of the
   *     miter limit value and the border radius.  This prevents
   *     long spikes being created.
   *     FT_STROKER_LINEJOIN_MITER_VARIABLE generates a mitered line
   *     join as used in XPS.  FT_STROKER_LINEJOIN_MITER is an alias
   *     for FT_STROKER_LINEJOIN_MITER_VARIABLE, retained for
   *     backwards compatibility.
