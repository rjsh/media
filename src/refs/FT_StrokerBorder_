   * @enum:
   *   FT_StrokerBorder
   *
   * @description:
   *   These values are used to select a given stroke border
   *   in @FT_Stroker_GetBorderCounts and @FT_Stroker_ExportBorder.
   *
   * @values:
   *   FT_STROKER_BORDER_LEFT ::
   *     Select the left border, relative to the drawing direction.
   *
   *   FT_STROKER_BORDER_RIGHT ::
   *     Select the right border, relative to the drawing direction.
   *
   * @note:
   *   Applications are generally interested in the `inside&apos; and `outside&apos;
   *   borders.  However, there is no direct mapping between these and the
   *   `left&apos; and `right&apos; ones, since this really depends on the glyph&apos;s
   *   drawing orientation, which varies between font formats.
   *
   *   You can however use @FT_Outline_GetInsideBorder and
   *   @FT_Outline_GetOutsideBorder to get these.
