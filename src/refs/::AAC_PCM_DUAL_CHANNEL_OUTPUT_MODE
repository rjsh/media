<doc f='include/fdk-aac/aacdecoder_lib.h' l='442'>/*!&lt; Defines how the decoder processes two channel signals:
                                                          0: Leave both signals as they are (default).
                                                          1: Create a dual mono output signal from channel 1.
                                                          2: Create a dual mono output signal from channel 2.
                                                          3: Create a dual mono output signal by mixing both channels (L&apos; = R&apos; = 0.5*Ch1 + 0.5*Ch2). */</doc>
