<doc f='include/pulse/stream.h' l='421'>/** Connect the stream to a sink. It is strongly recommended to pass
 * NULL in both \a dev and \a volume and not to set either
 * PA_STREAM_START_MUTED nor PA_STREAM_START_UNMUTED -- unless these
 * options are directly dependent on user input or configuration.
 *
 * If you follow this rule then the sound server will have the full
 * flexibility to choose the device, volume and mute status
 * automatically, based on server-side policies, heuristics and stored
 * information from previous uses. Also the server may choose to
 * reconfigure audio devices to make other sinks/sources or
 * capabilities available to be able to accept the stream.
 *
 * Before 0.9.20 it was not defined whether the \a volume parameter was
 * interpreted relative to the sink&apos;s current volume or treated as
 * an absolute device volume. Since 0.9.20 it is an absolute volume when
 * the sink is in flat volume mode, and relative otherwise, thus
 * making sure the volume passed here has always the same semantics as
 * the volume passed to pa_context_set_sink_input_volume(). */</doc>
