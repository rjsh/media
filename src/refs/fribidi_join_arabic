<doc f='include/fribidi/fribidi-joining.h' l='45'>/* fribidi_join_arabic - do Arabic joining
 *
 * This function does the Arabic joining algorithm.  Means, given Arabic
 * joining types of the characters in ar_props (don&apos;t worry,
 * FriBidiJoiningType can be casted to FriBidiArabicProp automagically), this
 * function modifies this properties to grasp the effect of neighboring
 * characters.  You probably need this information later to do Arabic shaping.
 *
 * This function implements rules R1 to R7 inclusive (all rules) of the Arabic
 * Cursive Joining algorithm of the Unicode standard as available at 
 * http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode4.0.0/ch08.pdf#G7462.  It also
 * interacts correctly with the bidirection algorithm as defined in Section
 * 3.5 Shaping of the Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm available at
 * http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr9/#Shaping.
 *
 * There are a few macros defined in fribidi-joining-types.h for querying the
 * Arabic properties computed by this function.
