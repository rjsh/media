 * \brief Register a callback for debug/info messages.
 * If a callback is registered, it is called for every message emitted by
 * libass.  The callback receives a format string and a list of arguments,
 * to be used for the printf family of functions. Additionally, a log level
 * from 0 (FATAL errors) to 7 (verbose DEBUG) is passed.  Usually, level 5
 * should be used by applications.
 * If no callback is set, all messages level &lt; 5 are printed to stderr,
 * prefixed with [ass].
 *
 * \param priv library handle
 * \param msg_cb pointer to callback function
 * \param data additional data, will be passed to callback
