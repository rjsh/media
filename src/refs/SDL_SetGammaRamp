<doc f='include/SDL/SDL_video.h' l='426'>/**
 * Set the gamma translation table for the red, green, and blue channels
 * of the video hardware.  Each table is an array of 256 16-bit quantities,
 * representing a mapping between the input and output for that channel.
 * The input is the index into the array, and the output is the 16-bit
 * gamma value at that index, scaled to the output color precision.
 * 
 * You may pass NULL for any of the channels to leave it unchanged.
 * If the call succeeds, it will return 0.  If the display driver or
 * hardware does not support gamma translation, or otherwise fails,
 * this function will return -1.
