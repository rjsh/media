Function name:

    DtsSetVideoParams

Description:

    Sets various codec parameters that would be used by a subsequent call
    to DtsStartDecoder.

    DtsSetVideoParams must always be called before DtsStartDecoder for the
    decoder to start processing input data. The device must have been
    previously opened for this call to succeed.

Parameters:
    hDevice         Handle to device. This is obtained via a prior call to
                    DtsDeviceOpen.
    videoAlg        Video Codec to be enabled to decode stream.
                    H.264 (0), VC-1 (4) and MPEG-2 (1) currently supported.
                    All other values will return BC_STS_INV_ARG
    FGTEnable       Enable processing of FGT SEI.
    MetaDataEnable  Enable retrieval of picture metadata to be sent to video
                    pipeline.
    Progressive     Instruct decoder to always try to send back progressive
                    frames. If input content is 1080p, the decoder will
                    ignore pull-down flags and always give 1080p output.
                    If 1080i content is processed, the decoder will return
                    1080i data. When this flag is not set, the decoder will
                    use pull-down information in the input stream to decide
                    the decoded data format.
    OptFlags        In this field bits 0:3 are used pass default frame rate,
                    bits 4:5 are for operation mode (used to indicate Blu-ray
                    mode to the decoder) and bit 6 is for the flag mpcOutPutMaxFRate
                    which when set tells the FW to output at the max rate for the
                    resolution and ignore the frame rate determined from the
                    stream. Bit 7 is set to indicate that this is single threaded mode
                    and the driver will be peeked to get timestamps ahead of time.

Return:

    BC_STS_SUCCESS will be returned on successful completion.
