 * Load an internal client into the Jack server.
 *
 * Internal clients run inside the JACK server process.  They can use
 * most of the same functions as external clients.  Each internal
 * client must declare jack_initialize() and jack_finish() entry
 * points, called at load and unload times.  See inprocess.c for an
 * example of how to write an internal client.
 *
 * @deprecated Please use jack_internal_client_load().
 *
 * @param client_name of at most jack_client_name_size() characters.
 *
 * @param load_name of a shared object file containing the code for
 * the new client.
 *
 * @param load_init an arbitary string passed to the jack_initialize()
 * routine of the new client (may be NULL).
 *
 * @return 0 if successful.
