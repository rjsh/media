Function name:

    DtsFlushInput

Description:

    Flushes the current channel and causes the decoder to stop accessing input
    data.  Based on the flush mode parameter, the channel will be flushed from
    the current point in the input data or from the current processing point.

    The device must have been previously opened for this call to succeed.

Parameters:

    hDevice         Handle to device. This is obtained via a prior call to
                    DtsDeviceOpen.
    Mode            0   Flush at the current input point. use to drain the
                        input FIFO . All the data that has been received will
                        be decoded.
                    1   Flush at the current processing point. All the decoded
                        frames will be presented but no more data from the
                        input will be decoded.
                    2   Flushes all the decoder buffers, input, decoded and
                        to be decoded.
                    3   Cancels the pending TX Request from the DIL/driver
					4	Flushes all the decoder buffers, input, decoded and
						to be decoded data. Also flushes the drivers buffers

Return:

    BC_STS_SUCCESS will be returned on successful completion.
