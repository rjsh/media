 * Seek to a specific location in a file.
 *
 * @param fd        Open file handle from smbc_open() or smbc_creat()
 *
 * @param offset    Offset in bytes from whence
 *
 * @param whence    A location in the file:
 *                  - SEEK_SET The offset is set to offset bytes from
 *                  the beginning of the file
 *                  - SEEK_CUR The offset is set to current location
 *                  plus offset bytes.
 *                  - SEEK_END The offset is set to the size of the
 *                  file plus offset bytes.
 *
 * @return          Upon successful completion, lseek returns the
 *                  resulting offset location as measured in bytes
 *                  from the beginning  of the file. Otherwise, a value
 *                  of (off_t)-1 is returned and errno is set to
 *                  indicate the error:
 *                  - EBADF  Fildes is not an open file descriptor.
 *                  - EINVAL Whence is not a proper value or smbc_init
 *		      not called.
 *
 * @todo Are all the whence values really supported?
 *
 * @todo Are errno values complete and correct?
