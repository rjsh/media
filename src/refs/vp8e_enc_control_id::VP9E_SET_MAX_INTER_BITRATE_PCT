   *
   * This value controls additional clamping on the maximum size of an
   * inter frame. It is expressed as a percentage of the average
   * per-frame bitrate, with the special (and default) value 0 meaning
   * unlimited, or no additional clamping beyond the codec&apos;s built-in
   * algorithm.
   *
   * For example, to allow no more than 4.5 frames worth of bitrate
   * to an inter frame, set this to 450.
   *
   * Supported in codecs: VP9
