 * This function takes a surface and copies it to a new surface of the
 * pixel format and colors of the video framebuffer, suitable for fast
 * blitting onto the display surface.  It calls SDL_ConvertSurface()
 *
 * If you want to take advantage of hardware colorkey or alpha blit
 * acceleration, you should set the colorkey and alpha value before
 * calling this function.
 *
 * If the conversion fails or runs out of memory, it returns NULL
