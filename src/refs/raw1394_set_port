 * raw1394_set_port - choose port for handle
 * @handle: libraw1394 handle
 * @port: port to connect to (corresponds to index of struct raw1394_portinfo)
 *
 * This function connects the handle to the port given (as queried with
 * raw1394_get_port_info()).  If successful, raw1394_get_port_info() and
 * raw1394_set_port() are not allowed to be called afterwards on this handle.
 * To make up for this, all the other functions (those handling asynchronous and
 * isochronous transmissions) can now be called.
 *
 * Returns: %0 for success or -1 for failure with errno set appropriately.  A
 * possible failure mode is with errno = %ESTALE, in this case the configuration
 * has changed since the call to raw1394_get_port_info() and it has to be called
 * again to update your view of the available ports.
