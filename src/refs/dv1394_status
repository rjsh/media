  A: DV video streams do not utilize 100% of the potential bandwidth offered
  by IEEE 1394 (FireWire). To achieve the correct rate of data transmission,
  DV devices must periodically insert empty packets into the 1394 data stream.
  Typically there is one empty packet per 14-16 data-carrying packets.

  Some DV devices will accept a wide range of empty packet rates, while others
  require a precise rate. If the dv1394 driver produces empty packets at
  a rate that your device does not accept, you may see ugly patterns on the
  DV output, or even no output at all.

  The default empty packet insertion rate seems to work for many people; if
  your DV output is stable, you can simply ignore this discussion. However,
  we have exposed the empty packet rate as a parameter to support devices that
  do not work with the default rate.

  The decision to insert an empty packet is made with a numerator/denominator
  algorithm. Empty packets are produced at an average rate of CIP_N / CIP_D.
  You can alter the empty packet rate by passing non-zero values for cip_n
  and cip_d to the INIT ioctl.
