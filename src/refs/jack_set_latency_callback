<doc f='include/jack/jack.h' l='408'>/**
 * Tell the Jack server to call @a latency_callback whenever it
 * is necessary to recompute the latencies for some or all
 * Jack ports.
 *
 * @a latency_callback will be called twice each time it is
 * needed, once being passed JackCaptureLatency and once
 * JackPlaybackLatency. See @ref LatencyFunctions for
 * the definition of each type of latency and related functions.
 *
 * &lt;b&gt;IMPORTANT: Most JACK clients do NOT need to register a latency
 * callback.&lt;/b&gt;
 *
 * Clients that meet any of the following conditions do NOT
 * need to register a latency callback:
 *
 *    - have only input ports
 *    - have only output ports
 *    - their output is totally unrelated to their input
 *    - their output is not delayed relative to their input
 *        (i.e. data that arrives in a given process() 
 *         callback is processed and output again in the
 *         same callback)
 *
 * Clients NOT registering a latency callback MUST also
 * satisfy this condition:
 * 
 *    - have no multiple distinct internal signal pathways
 *      
 * This means that if your client has more than 1 input and
 * output port, and considers them always &quot;correlated&quot;
 * (e.g. as a stereo pair), then there is only 1 (e.g. stereo)
 * signal pathway through the client. This would be true,
 * for example, of a stereo FX rack client that has a
 * left/right input pair and a left/right output pair.
 * 
 * However, this is somewhat a matter of perspective. The
 * same FX rack client could be connected so that its 
 * two input ports were connected to entirely separate
 * sources. Under these conditions, the fact that the client
 * does not register a latency callback MAY result
 * in port latency values being incorrect. 
 *
 * Clients that do not meet any of those conditions SHOULD
 * register a latency callback. 
 *
 * See the documentation for  @ref jack_port_set_latency_range() 
 * on how the callback should operate. Remember that the @a mode
 * argument given to the latency callback will need to be
 * passed into @ref jack_port_set_latency_range()
 *
 * @return 0 on success, otherwise a non-zero error code
