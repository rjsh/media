 * \brief Queries video filter capabilities.
 *
 * This function returns the list of capabilities supported by the driver
 * for a specific video filter. The \c filter_caps array is allocated by
 * the user and \c num_filter_caps shall be initialized to the number
 * of allocated elements in that array. Upon successful return, the
 * actual number of filters will be overwritten into \c num_filter_caps.
 * Otherwise, \c VA_STATUS_ERROR_MAX_NUM_EXCEEDED is returned and
 * \c num_filter_caps is adjusted to the number of elements that would be
 * returned if enough space was available.
 *
 * @param[in] dpy               the VA display
