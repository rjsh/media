 * &quot;Phosphor&quot; deinterlace algorithm: framerate-doubling CRT TV simulator.
 *
 * There is no &quot;1x&quot; mode in this filter; only framerate doubling is supported.
 *
 * There is no input frame parameter, because the input frames
 * are taken from the history buffer.
 *
 * Soft field repeat (repeat_pict) is supported. Note that the generated
 * &quot;repeated&quot; output picture is unique because of the simulated light decay.
 * Its &quot;old&quot; field comes from the same input frame as the &quot;new&quot; one, unlike
 * the first output picture of the same frame.
 *
 * As many output frames should be requested for each input frame as is
 * indicated by p_src-&gt;i_nb_fields. This is done by calling this function
 * several times, first with i_order = 0, and then with all other parameters
 * the same, but a new p_dst, increasing i_order (1 for second field,
 * and then if i_nb_fields = 3, also i_order = 2 to get the repeated first
 * field), and alternating i_field (starting, at i_order = 0, with the field
 * according to p_src-&gt;b_top_field_first). See Deinterlace() for an example.
 *
 * @param p_filter The filter instance. Must be non-NULL.
 * @param p_dst Output frame. Must be allocated by caller.
 * @param i_order Temporal field number: 0 = first, 1 = second, 2 = rep. first.
 * @param i_field Render which field? 0 = top field, 1 = bottom field.
 * @return VLC error code (int).
 * @retval VLC_SUCCESS The requested field was rendered into p_dst.
 * @retval VLC_EGENERIC No pictures in history buffer, cannot render.
 * @see RenderBob()
 * @see RenderLinear()
