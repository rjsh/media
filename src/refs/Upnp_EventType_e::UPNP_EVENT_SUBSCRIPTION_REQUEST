	 * The \b Event parameter contains a pointer to a \b
	 * UpnpSubscriptionRequest structure.  At this point, the
	 * subscription has already been accepted.  \b UpnpAcceptSubscription
	 * needs to be called to confirm the subscription and transmit the
	 * initial state table.  This can be done during this callback.  The SDK
	 * generates no events for a subscription unless the device 
	 * application calls \b UpnpAcceptSubscription.
