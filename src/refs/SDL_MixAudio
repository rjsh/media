 * This takes two audio buffers of the playing audio format and mixes
 * them, performing addition, volume adjustment, and overflow clipping.
 * The volume ranges from 0 - 128, and should be set to SDL_MIX_MAXVOLUME
 * for full audio volume.  Note this does not change hardware volume.
 * This is provided for convenience -- you can mix your own audio data.
