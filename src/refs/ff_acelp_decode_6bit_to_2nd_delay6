 * @brief Decode pitch delay of the second subframe encoded by 6 bits
 *        with 1/6 precision.
 * @param ac_index adaptive codebook index (6 bits)
 * @param pitch_delay_min lower bound (integer) of pitch delay interval for
 *                      second subframe
 *
 * @return pitch delay in 1/6 units
 *
 * Pitch delay is coded:
 *    with 1/6 resolution, -6 &lt; pitch_delay - int(prev_pitch_delay) &lt; 5
 *
 * @remark The routine is used in AMR @@12.2k for the second and fourth subframes.
