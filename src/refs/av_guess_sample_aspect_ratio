<doc f='ffmpeg/libavformat/avformat.h' l='2873'>/**
 * Guess the sample aspect ratio of a frame, based on both the stream and the
 * frame aspect ratio.
 *
 * Since the frame aspect ratio is set by the codec but the stream aspect ratio
 * is set by the demuxer, these two may not be equal. This function tries to
 * return the value that you should use if you would like to display the frame.
 *
 * Basic logic is to use the stream aspect ratio if it is set to something sane
 * otherwise use the frame aspect ratio. This way a container setting, which is
 * usually easy to modify can override the coded value in the frames.
 *
 * @param format the format context which the stream is part of
 * @param stream the stream which the frame is part of
 * @param frame the frame with the aspect ratio to be determined
 * @return the guessed (valid) sample_aspect_ratio, 0/1 if no idea
