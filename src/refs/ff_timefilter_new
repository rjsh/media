<doc f='ffmpeg/libavdevice/timefilter.h' l='39'>/**
 * Create a new Delay Locked Loop time filter
 *
 * feedback2_factor and feedback3_factor are the factors used for the
 * multiplications that are respectively performed in the second and third
 * feedback paths of the loop.
 *
 * Unless you know what you are doing, you should set these as follow:
 *
 * o = 2 * M_PI * bandwidth * period_in_seconds
 * feedback2_factor = sqrt(2) * o
 * feedback3_factor = o * o
 *
 * Where bandwidth is up to you to choose. Smaller values will filter out more
 * of the jitter, but also take a longer time for the loop to settle. A good
 * starting point is something between 0.3 and 3 Hz.
 *
 * @param time_base   period of the hardware clock in seconds
 *                    (for example 1.0/44100)
 * @param period      expected update interval, in input units
 * @param brandwidth  filtering bandwidth, in Hz
 *
 * @return a pointer to a TimeFilter struct, or NULL on error
 *
