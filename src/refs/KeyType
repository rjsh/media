 * An apple http stream consists of a playlist with media segment files,
 * played sequentially. There may be several playlists with the same
 * video content, in different bandwidth variants, that are played in
 * parallel (preferably only one bandwidth variant at a time). In this case,
 * the user supplied the url to a main playlist that only lists the variant
 * playlists.
 *
 * If the main playlist doesn&apos;t point at any variants, we still create
 * one anonymous toplevel variant for this, to maintain the structure.
