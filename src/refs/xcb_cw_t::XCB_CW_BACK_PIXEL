<doc f='include/xcb/xproto.h' l='1334'>/**&lt; Overrides the default background-pixmap. The background pixmap and window must
have the same root and same depth. Any size pixmap can be used, although some
sizes may be faster than others.

If `XCB_BACK_PIXMAP_NONE` is specified, the window has no defined background.
The server may fill the contents with the previous screen contents or with
contents of its own choosing.

If `XCB_BACK_PIXMAP_PARENT_RELATIVE` is specified, the parent&apos;s background is
used, but the window must have the same depth as the parent (or a Match error
results).   The parent&apos;s background is tracked, and the current version is
used each time the window background is required. */</doc>
