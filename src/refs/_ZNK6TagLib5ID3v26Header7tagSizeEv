       * Returns the tag size in bytes.  This is the size of the frame content.
       * The size of the \e entire tag will be this plus the header size (10
       * bytes) and, if present, the footer size (potentially another 10 bytes).
       *
       * \note This is the value as read from the header to which TagLib attempts
       * to provide an API to; it was not a design decision on the part of TagLib
       * to not include the mentioned portions of the tag in the \e size.
