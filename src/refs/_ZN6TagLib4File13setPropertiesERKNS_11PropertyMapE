     * Sets the tags of this File to those specified in \a properties. Calls the
     * according specialization method in the subclasses of File to do the translation
     * into the format-specific details.
     * If some value(s) could not be written imported to the specific metadata format,
     * the returned PropertyMap will contain those value(s). Otherwise it will be empty,
     * indicating that no problems occured.
     * With file types that support several tag formats (for instance, MP3 files can have
     * ID3v1, ID3v2, and APEv2 tags), this function will create the most appropriate one
     * (ID3v2 for MP3 files). Older formats will be updated as well, if they exist, but won&apos;t
     * be taken into account for the return value of this function.
     * See the documentation of the subclass implementations for detailed descriptions.
     * BIC: will become pure virtual in the future
