     * Should be set instead of @ref AVFilter.init &quot;init&quot; by the filters that
     * want to pass a dictionary of AVOptions to nested contexts that are
     * allocated during init.
     *
     * On return, the options dict should be freed and replaced with one that
     * contains all the options which could not be processed by this filter (or
     * with NULL if all the options were processed).
     *
     * Otherwise the semantics is the same as for @ref AVFilter.init &quot;init&quot;.
