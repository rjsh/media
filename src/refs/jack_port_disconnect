 * Perform the same function as jack_disconnect() using port handles
 * rather than names.  This avoids the name lookup inherent in the
 * name-based version.
 *
 * Clients connecting their own ports are likely to use this function,
 * while generic connection clients (e.g. patchbays) would use
 * jack_disconnect().
