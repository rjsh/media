<dec f='include/SDL/SDL_video.h' l='633' type='int SDL_SetAlpha(SDL_Surface * surface, Uint32 flag, Uint8 alpha)'/>
<doc f='include/SDL/SDL_video.h' l='618'>/**
 * This function sets the alpha value for the entire surface, as opposed to
 * using the alpha component of each pixel. This value measures the range
 * of transparency of the surface, 0 being completely transparent to 255
 * being completely opaque. An &apos;alpha&apos; value of 255 causes blits to be
 * opaque, the source pixels copied to the destination (the default). Note
 * that per-surface alpha can be combined with colorkey transparency.
 *
 * If &apos;flag&apos; is 0, alpha blending is disabled for the surface.
 * If &apos;flag&apos; is SDL_SRCALPHA, alpha blending is enabled for the surface.
 * OR:ing the flag with SDL_RLEACCEL requests RLE acceleration for the
 * surface; if SDL_RLEACCEL is not specified, the RLE accel will be removed.
 *
 * The &apos;alpha&apos; parameter is ignored for surfaces that have an alpha channel.
