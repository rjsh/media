     * Returns the offset in the file that \a pattern occurs at or -1 if it can
     * not be found.  If \a before is set, the search will only continue until the
     * pattern \a before is found.  This is useful for tagging purposes to search
     * for a tag before the synch frame.
     *
     * Searching starts at \a fromOffset and proceeds from the that point to the
     * beginning of the file and defaults to the end of the file.
     *
     * \note This has the practial limitation that \a pattern can not be longer
     * than the buffer size used by readBlock().  Currently this is 1024 bytes.
