       * Returns a pointer to a tag that is the union of the ID3v2 and ID3v1
       * tags. The ID3v2 tag is given priority in reading the information -- if
       * requested information exists in both the ID3v2 tag and the ID3v1 tag,
       * the information from the ID3v2 tag will be returned.
       *
       * If you would like more granular control over the content of the tags,
       * with the concession of generality, use the tag-type specific calls.
       *
       * \note As this tag is not implemented as an ID3v2 tag or an ID3v1 tag,
       * but a union of the two this pointer may not be cast to the specific
       * tag types.
       *
