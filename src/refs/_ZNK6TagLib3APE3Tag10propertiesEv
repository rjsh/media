       * Implements the unified tag dictionary interface -- export function.
       * APE tags are perfectly compatible with the dictionary interface because they
       * support both arbitrary tag names and multiple values. Currently only
       * APE items of type *Text* are handled by the dictionary interface; all *Binary*
       * and *Locator* items will be put into the unsupportedData list and can be
       * deleted on request using removeUnsupportedProperties(). The same happens
       * to Text items if their key is invalid for PropertyMap (which should actually
       * never happen).
       *
       * The only conversion done by this export function is to rename the APE tags
       * TRACK to TRACKNUMBER, YEAR to DATE, and ALBUM ARTIST to ALBUMARTIST, respectively,
       * in order to be compliant with the names used in other formats.
