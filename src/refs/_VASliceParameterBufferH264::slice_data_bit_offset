     * \brief Bit offset from NAL Header Unit to the begining of slice_data().
     *
     * This bit offset is relative to and includes the NAL unit byte
     * and represents the number of bits parsed in the slice_header()
     * after the removal of any emulation prevention bytes in
     * there. However, the slice data buffer passed to the hardware is
     * the original bitstream, thus including any emulation prevention
     * bytes.
