 * Set @a alias as an alias for @a port.  May be called at any time.
 * If the alias is longer than jack_port_name_size(), it will be truncated.
 * 
 * After a successful call, and until JACK exits or
 * jack_port_unset_alias() is called, may be

 * Ports can have up to two aliases - if both are already

 * @return 0 on success, otherwise a non-zero error code.
