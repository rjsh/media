 * Start/Stop JACK&apos;s &quot;freewheel&quot; mode.
 *
 * When in &quot;freewheel&quot; mode, JACK no longer waits for
 * any external event to begin the start of the next process
 * cycle. 
 *
 * As a result, freewheel mode causes &quot;faster than realtime&quot;
 * execution of a JACK graph. If possessed, real-time
 * scheduling is dropped when entering freewheel mode, and
 * if appropriate it is reacquired when stopping.
 * 
 * IMPORTANT: on systems using capabilities to provide real-time
 * scheduling (i.e. Linux kernel 2.4), if onoff is zero, this function
 * must be called from the thread that originally called jack_activate(). 
 * This restriction does not apply to other systems (e.g. Linux kernel 2.6 
 * or OS X).
 * 
 * @param client pointer to JACK client structure
 * @param onoff  if non-zero, freewheel mode starts. Otherwise
 *                  freewheel mode ends.
 *
 * @return 0 on success, otherwise a non-zero error code.
