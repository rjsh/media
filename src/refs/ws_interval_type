   Format of the extradata and packets

   THIS INFORMATION IS NOT PART OF THE PUBLIC API OR ABI.
   IT CAN CHANGE WITHOUT NOTIFICATION.

   All numbers are in little endian.

   The codec extradata define a set of intervals with uniform content.
   Overlapping intervals are added together.

   extradata:
       uint32      number of intervals
       ...         intervals

   interval:
       int64       start timestamp; time_base must be 1/sample_rate;
                   start timestamps must be in ascending order
       int64       end timestamp
       uint32      type
       uint32      channels mask
       ...         additional information, depends on type

   sine interval (type fourcc &quot;SINE&quot;):
       int32       start frequency, in 1/(1&lt;&lt;16) Hz
       int32       end frequency
       int32       start amplitude, 1&lt;&lt;16 is the full amplitude
       int32       end amplitude
       uint32      start phase, 0 is sin(0), 0x20000000 is sin(pi/2), etc.;
                   n | (1&lt;&lt;31) means to match the phase of previous channel #n

   pink noise interval (type fourcc &quot;NOIS&quot;):
       int32       start amplitude
       int32       end amplitude

   The input packets encode the time and duration of the requested segment.

   packet:
       int64       start timestamp
       int32       duration
