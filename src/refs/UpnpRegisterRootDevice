 * \brief Registers a device application with the UPnP Library.
 *
 * A device application cannot make any other API calls until it registers
 * using this function.
 *
 * Device applications can also register as control points (see 
 * \b UpnpRegisterClient to get a control point handle to perform control
 * point functionality).
 *
 * This is a synchronous call and does not generate any callbacks. Callbacks
 * can occur as soon as this function returns.
 *
 *  \return An integer representing one of the following:
 *      \li \c UPNP_E_SUCCESS: The operation completed successfully.
 *      \li \c UPNP_E_FINISH: The SDK is already terminated or is not
 *		initialized.
 *      \li \c UPNP_E_INVALID_DESC: The description document was not 
 *		a valid device description.
 *      \li \c UPNP_E_INVALID_URL: The URL for the description document 
 *              is not valid.
 *      \li \c UPNP_E_INVALID_PARAM: Either \b Callback or \b Hnd 
 *              is not a valid pointer or \b DescURL is \c NULL.
 *      \li \c UPNP_E_NETWORK_ERROR: A network error occurred.
 *      \li \c UPNP_E_SOCKET_WRITE: An error or timeout occurred writing 
 *              to a socket.
 *      \li \c UPNP_E_SOCKET_READ: An error or timeout occurred reading 
 *              from a socket.
 *      \li \c UPNP_E_SOCKET_BIND: An error occurred binding a socket.
 *      \li \c UPNP_E_SOCKET_CONNECT: An error occurred connecting the 
 *              socket.
 *      \li \c UPNP_E_OUTOF_SOCKET: Too many sockets are currently 
 *              allocated.
 *      \li \c UPNP_E_OUTOF_MEMORY: There are insufficient resources to 
 *              register this root device.
