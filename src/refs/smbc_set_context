 * Set or retrieve the compatibility library&apos;s context pointer
 *
 * @param context   New context to use, or NULL.  If a new context is provided,
 *                  it must have allocated with smbc_new_context() and
 *                  initialized with smbc_init_context(), followed, optionally,
 *                  by some manual changes to some of the non-internal fields.
 *
 * @return          The old context.
 *
 * @see             smbc_new_context(), smbc_init_context(), smbc_init()
 *
 * @note            This function may be called prior to smbc_init() to force
 *                  use of the next context without any internal calls to
 *                  smbc_new_context() or smbc_init_context().  It may also
 *                  be called after smbc_init() has already called those two
 *                  functions, to replace the existing context with a new one.
 *                  Care should be taken, in this latter case, to ensure that
 *                  the server cache and any data allocated by the
 *                  authentication functions have been freed, if necessary.
