 * If there is data at the current read index, \a data will point to
 * the actual data and \a nbytes will contain the size of the data in
 * bytes (which can be less or more than a complete fragment).
 *
 * If there is no data at the current read index, it means that either
 * the buffer is empty or it contains a hole (that is, the write index
 * is ahead of the read index but there&apos;s no data where the read index
 * points at). If the buffer is empty, \a data will be NULL and
 * \a nbytes will be 0. If there is a hole, \a data will be NULL and
 * \a nbytes will contain the length of the hole.
 *
 * Use pa_stream_drop() to actually remove the data from the buffer
 * and move the read index forward. pa_stream_drop() should not be
 * called if the buffer is empty, but it should be called if there is
 * a hole. */</doc>
