<doc f='include/fdk-aac/aacdecoder_lib.h' l='433'>/*!&lt; Number of PCM output channels (if different from encoded audio channels, downmixing or
                                                          upmixing is applied). \n
                                                          -1: Disable up-/downmixing. The decoder output contains the same number of channels as the
                                                              encoded bitstream. \n
                                                           1: The decoder performs a mono matrix mix-down if the encoded audio channels are greater
                                                              than one. Thus it ouputs always exact one channel. \n
                                                           2: The decoder performs a stereo matrix mix-down if the encoded audio channels are greater
                                                              than two. If the encoded audio channels are smaller than two the decoder duplicates the
                                                              output. Thus it ouputs always exact two channels. \n */</doc>
