 * This function takes a surface and copies it to a new surface of the
 * pixel format and colors of the video framebuffer (if possible),
 * suitable for fast alpha blitting onto the display surface.
 * The new surface will always have an alpha channel.
 *
 * If you want to take advantage of hardware colorkey or alpha blit
 * acceleration, you should set the colorkey and alpha value before
 * calling this function.
 *
 * If the conversion fails or runs out of memory, it returns NULL
