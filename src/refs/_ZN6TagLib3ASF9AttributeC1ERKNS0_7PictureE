       * Constructs an attribute with \a key and a Picture \a value.
       *
       * This attribute is compatible with the ID3 frame, APIC. The ID3 specification for the APIC frame stipulates that,
       * while there may be any number of APIC frames associated with a file,
       * only one may be of type 1 and only one may be of type 2.
       *
       * The specification also states that the description of the picture can be no longer than 64 characters, but can be empty.
       * WM/Picture attributes added with TagLib::ASF are not automatically validated to conform to ID3 specifications.
       * You must add code in your application to perform validations if you want to maintain complete compatibility with ID3.
