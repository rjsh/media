 * Register (or unregister) as a @ref slowsyncclients &quot;slow-sync client&quot;, that cannot
 * respond immediately to transport position changes.
 *
 * The @a sync_callback will be invoked at the first available
 * opportunity after its registration is complete.  If the client is
 * currently active this will be the following process cycle,
 * otherwise it will be the first cycle after calling jack_activate().
 * After that, it runs according to the ::JackSyncCallback rules.
 * Clients that don&apos;t set a @a sync_callback are assumed to be ready
 * immediately any time the transport wants to start.
 *
 * @param client the JACK client structure.
 * @param sync_callback is a realtime function that returns TRUE when
 * the client is ready.  Setting @a sync_callback to NULL declares that
 * this client no longer requires slow-sync processing.
 * @param arg an argument for the @a sync_callback function.
 *
 * @return 0 on success, otherwise a non-zero error code.
