<doc f='include/upnp/ixml.h' l='466'>/*! 
 * \brief Inserts a new child \b Node before the existing child \b Node.
 *
 * \b refChild can be \c NULL, which inserts \b newChild at the
 * end of the list of children.  Note that the \b Node (or \b Nodes) 
 * in \b newChild must already be owned by the owner document (or have no
 * owner at all) of \b nodeptr for insertion.  If not, the \b Node 
 * (or \b Nodes) must be imported into the document using 
 * \b ixmlDocument_importNode.  If \b newChild is already in the tree,
 * it is removed first.
 *
 * \return An integer representing one of the following:
 *     \li \c IXML_SUCCESS: The operation completed successfully.
 *     \li \c IXML_INVALID_PARAMETER: Either \b nodeptr or 
 *           \b newChild is \c NULL.
 *     \li \c IXML_HIERARCHY_REQUEST_ERR: The type of the \b Node 
 *           does not allow children of the type of \b newChild.
 *     \li \c IXML_WRONG_DOCUMENT_ERR: \b newChild has an owner 
 *           document that does not match the owner of \b nodeptr.
 *     \li \c IXML_NO_MODIFICATION_ALLOWED_ERR: \b nodeptr is 
 *           read-only or the parent of the \b Node being inserted is 
 *           read-only.
 *     \li \c IXML_NOT_FOUND_ERR: \b refChild is not a child of 
 *           \b nodeptr.
