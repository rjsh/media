Function name:

    DtsProcOutput

Description:

    Returns one decoded picture to the caller.

    The device must have been previously opened for this call to succeed.

    == NOTE ====
        For PIB AND 100% output encryption/scrambling on Bcm LINK hardware
    use ProcOutputNoCopy() Interace. This interface will not support
    PIB encryption.


Parameters:

    hDevice         Handle to device. This is obtained via a prior call to
                    DtsDeviceOpen.
    milliSecWait    Timeout parameter. DtsProcOutput will fail is no picture
                    is received in this time.
    *pOut           This is a pointer to the BC_DTS_PROC_OUT structure that is
                    allocated by the caller. The decoded picture is returned
                    in this structure. This structure is described in the
                    data structures section. The actual data buffer to be
                    filled with the decoded data is allocated by the caller.
                    Data is copied from the decoder to the buffers before this
                    function returns. [INPUT/OUTPUT]

Return:

    BC_STS_SUCCESS will be returned on successful completion.
