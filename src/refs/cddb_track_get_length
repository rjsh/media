 * Get the length of the track in seconds.  If the track length is not
 * defined this routine will try to calculate it using the frame
 * offsets of the tracks and the total disc length.  These
 * calculations will do no rounding to the nearest second.  So it is
 * possible that the sum off all track lengths does not add up to the
 * actual disc length.  If the length can not be calculated -1 will be
 * returned.

 * @param track The CDDB track structure.
 * @return The track length.
