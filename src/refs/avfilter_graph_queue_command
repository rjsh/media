 *               otherwise it can be a filter or filter instance name
 *               which will send the command to all matching filters.
 * @param cmd    the command to sent, for handling simplicity all commands must be alphanumeric only
 * @param arg    the argument for the command
 * @param ts     time at which the command should be sent to the filter

 * @note As this executes commands after this function returns, no return code
 *       from the filter is provided, also AVFILTER_CMD_FLAG_ONE is not supported.
