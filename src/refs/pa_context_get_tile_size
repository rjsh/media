<doc f='include/pulse/context.h' l='268'>/** Return the optimal block size for passing around audio buffers. It
 * is recommended to allocate buffers of the size returned here when
 * writing audio data to playback streams, if the latency constraints
 * permit this. It is not recommended writing larger blocks than this
 * because usually they will then be split up internally into chunks
 * of this size. It is not recommended writing smaller blocks than
 * this (unless required due to latency demands) because this
 * increases CPU usage. If ss is NULL you will be returned the
 * byte-exact tile size. If you pass a valid ss, then the tile size
 * will be rounded down to multiple of the frame size. This is
 * supposed to be used in a construct such as
 * pa_context_get_tile_size(pa_stream_get_context(s),
 * pa_stream_get_sample_spec(ss)); \since 0.9.20 */</doc>
