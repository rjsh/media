 * Get whether to use the same connection for all shares on a server.
 *
 * Some Windows versions appear to have a limit to the number
 * of concurrent SESSIONs and/or TREE CONNECTions.  In
 * one-shot programs (i.e. the program runs and then quickly
 * ends, thereby shutting down all connections), it is
 * probably reasonable to establish a new connection for each
 * share.  In long-running applications, the limitation can be
 * avoided by using only a single connection to each server,
 * and issuing a new TREE CONNECT when the share is accessed.
