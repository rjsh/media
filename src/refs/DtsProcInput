Function name:

    DtsProcInput

Description:

    Sends compressed (coded) data to the decoder for processing.

    The device must have been previously opened for this call to succeed.
    In addition, suitable keys must have been exchanged for decryption and
    decode to be successful.

Parameters:

    hDevice     Handle to device. This is obtained via a prior call to
                DtsDeviceOpen.
    pUserData   Pointer to data buffer that holds the data to be transferred.
                [INPUT]
    sizeInBytes Size in Bytes of data available to be sent to the decoder for
                processing.
    Timestamp   Optional timestamp information attached to the media sample
                that is available in the buffer. If timestamp is present
                (i.e. non-zero), then this will be reflected in the output
                sample (picture) produced from the contents of this buffer.
				Timestamp should be in units of 100 ns.
    Encrypted   Flag to indicate that the data transfer is not in the clear
                and that the decoder needs to decrypt before it can decode
                the data.  Note that due to complexity, it is preferred that
                the application writer uses the higher level
                dts_pre_proc_input() call if encypted content will be sent.

Return:

    BC_STS_SUCCESS will be returned on successful completion.
