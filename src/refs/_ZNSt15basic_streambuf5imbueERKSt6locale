       *  @brief  Changes translations.
       *  @param  __loc  A new locale.

       *  Translations done during I/O which depend on the current
       *  locale are changed by this call.  The standard adds,
       *  &lt;em&gt;Between invocations of this function a class derived
       *  from streambuf can safely cache results of calls to locale
       *  functions and to members of facets so obtained.&lt;/em&gt;

       *  @note  Base class version does nothing.
