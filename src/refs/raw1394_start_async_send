 * raw1394_start_async_send - send an asynchronous packet
 * @handle: libraw1394 handle
 * @length: the amount of bytes of data to send
 * @header_length: the number of bytes in the header
 * @expect_response: indicate with a 0 or 1 whether to receive a completion event
 * @data: pointer to data to send
 * @rawtag: data to identify the request to completion handler
 *
 * This starts sending an arbitrary async packet. It gets an array of quadlets
 * consisting of header and data (without CRC in between). Header information
 * is always in machine byte order, data (data block as well as quadlet data
 * in a read response for data quadlet) shall be in big endian byte order.
 * expect_response indicates, if we expect a response (i.e. if we will get the
 * tag back after the packet was sent or after a response arrived). length is
 * the length of the complete packet (header_length + length of the data block).
 * The main purpose of this function is to send responses for incoming
 * transactions, that are handled by the application.
 * Do not use that function, unless you really know, what you do! Sending
 * corrupt packet may lead to weird results.
 *
 * Returns: &gt;= 0 on success or -1 on failure (sets errno)
