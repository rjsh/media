 * Request a complete recomputation of all port latencies. This
 * can be called by a client that has just changed the internal
 * latency of its port using  jack_port_set_latency
 * and wants to ensure that all signal pathways in the graph
 * are updated with respect to the values that will be returned
 * by  jack_port_get_total_latency. It allows a client 
 * to change multiple port latencies without triggering a 
 * recompute for each change.
 * 
 * @return zero for successful execution of the request. non-zero
 *         otherwise.
