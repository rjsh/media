   * Method to handle a noteon event (synthesize the instrument).
   * @param preset Virtual SoundFont preset
   * @param synth Synthesizer instance
   * @param chan MIDI channel number of the note on event
   * @param key MIDI note number (0-127)
   * @param vel MIDI velocity (0-127)
   * @return #FLUID_OK on success (0) or #FLUID_FAILED (-1) otherwise
   *
   * This method may be called from within synthesis context and therefore
   * should be as efficient as possible and not perform any operations considered
   * bad for realtime audio output (memory allocations and other OS calls).
   *
   * Call fluid_synth_alloc_voice() for every sample that has
   * to be played. fluid_synth_alloc_voice() expects a pointer to a
   * #fluid_sample_t structure and returns a pointer to the opaque
   * #fluid_voice_t structure. To set or increment the values of a
   * generator, use fluid_voice_gen_set() or fluid_voice_gen_incr(). When you are
   * finished initializing the voice call fluid_voice_start() to
   * start playing the synthesis voice.  Starting with FluidSynth 1.1.0 all voices
   * created will be started at the same time.
